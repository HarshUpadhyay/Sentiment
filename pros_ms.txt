review1: 1. If you love tech, this is a great place. No doubt you&#039;ll talk tech (mostly the MSFT stack) from enterprise to consumer - from PCs to phones to Xboxes - from datacenter to desktop. 2. What were GREAT benefits are now VERY GOOD (took a small step down) but still probably better than you&#039;ll find at 99% of large corporations. If you&#039;ve got family - the value of the benefits is even higher. 401k match is nice. 3. Even with it&#039;s struggles MSFT is still a cash printing machine. This means if you can keep your nose clean and do reasonable work, you can have a stable job, pay your bills, feed your family, and not worry (too much) about layoffs. The stock you own likely won&#039;t tank, but probably won&#039;t go up much either. You&#039;ll get a bonus each year and some stock. It&#039;s a decent life if you aren&#039;t looking to light the world on fire.</p> 
review2: 1) Great working environment 2) Excellent pay 3) If you are a quick leaner, it is a great place for you!</p>

review4: Great company culture that values open communication. Relaxed, casual workplace lets great people do their best work. Opportunities to work on challenging problems with intelligent people. Very inclusive, with a diverse workforce. Competitive pay and benefits.</p> 
review5: - The benefits are very good. Like everyone else they are trying to cut costs but still they were above average in the industry. I moved from Microsft to Google and definitely the medical benefits and most of other are the same. - Company is huge so there is a lot of space to find interesting projects in almost any computer science field. - Company invests in teaching. There is an entire division dedicated to internal education and you can learn a lot if you are driven and plan your time well. You get time off for this so it is not double duty. - In my experience the people are professional and friendly especially if you are an engineer up to mid-level management (dev leads, dev managers). - Ballmer is gone. The new guy Satya seems to know what he is doing. I get this from the many friends I have left at Microsoft and from watching the public moves the company makes. - They are stongly poitioned to take advantage of the cloud revolution (Azure is a distant number two after Amazon)</p> 
review6: Good balance of compensation vs effort to meet performance expectations, good work/life flexibility, potential for variety of work, company&#039;s strong financial position.

review253: Great pay and talented people</p> 
review253: I&#039;ve worked at Microsoft and in the IT organization for over a decade. Microsoft is truly an amazing place. * Extremely smart people * Truly innovative * Amazing benefits * Your work is truly valued * If your organization and management believe in your long-term potential and your ability to grow and lead, there are leadership development programs (HiPo/High Potential Program, Key Talent, etc.) * Ability to experience various products, services, organizations etc. * Things are positively changing under the leadership of Satya Nadella. There is a positive buzz internally, the industry and investors are responding positively. Our stock prices have shot up. We are truly embracing change and newer/innovative products (Hololens, Surface Book etc.) are being released. * Under Satya&#039;s leadership and new review model, Employees are measured on business impact (reduces unnecessary politics and brown-nosing, and focus is on impact/results), how they leverage the work of others and build on top of others work (reduces duplication of work across teams/organizations, and increases collaboration), and how employees have helped others to be successful (focus changes from individual success to team success). * Microsoft has done away with the older performance review system (1 - Outstanding ... all the way to 5 - Very poor/no impact). This was a forced curve, meaning people managers had to find employees to fit in each category leading to some unfavorable behavior and culture. The newer model no longer rates employees on the 1-5 scale, and there is no &#034;calibration&#034; exercise (forced curve). However, as a manager one still has to &#039;differentiate&#039; employees based on impact. * Satya meets with his directs and product group leaders/engineering leaders weekly/several times a month. He also has frequent employee all-hands where he talks to employees, and everyone in the company has a chance to ask him questions directly. He is well connected with his leadership team, knows what is happening at the top across the company, and he is well connected with employees at the grass-root level. True leader and positively leading the company in the right direction</p>

review306: - Many brilliant people - Incredibly broad product range - if it&#039;s tech and you&#039;re interested in it, Microsoft works on it - Opportunities for synergy - when different product lines work well together, amazing things can result. - Growth-oriented culture: the company (mostly) knows it&#039;s behind and needs to do better, and there is a great openness to change and feedback. - Benefits: all sorts of great benefits, from very good health care to free gym membership to bicycle commuter reimbursement, they take care of you pretty much any way they can think of (except no free food, which apparently is due to the lack of cafeteria space). - Giving campaign: Microsoft gives the most money per capita to charity of any company. And no, Bill Gates doesn&#039;t count towards that :). - Satya Nadella appears to be a good CEO. He is open to innovation, to change, in a way that Ballmer wasn&#039;t, and he&#039;s generated a lot of positive sentiment around the company. - Pay is competitive. Others may pay somewhat more but it&#039;s all enough that pay isn&#039;t the deciding factor. - Flexible hours, decent work-life balance in most groups</p>

They are also uniquely positioned for hybrid (cloud an on-premise) environments and solutions, which are strategic and high-value for enterprise customers.

review398: Lots of career options to choose from. A lot of training options provided.</p> 
review399: Great benefits. Great technical culture. Very innovation. Lots of money to earn from</p> 
review400: Have not worked there since the new CEO took over so I don&#039;t know how it has changed. Could be good or bad depends on what has changed since the new CEO.</p> 
review401: Pay is really good, benefits and total comp are pretty competitive. Cost of living is lower in WA than in CA. Easier workload than other hardware companies I&#039;ve worked for.</p> 
review402: Improved vision with new leadership, good work life balance, smart people to work with.</p> 
review403: The nice culture and good salary</p> 
review404: It really depends on which team you end up in, but I got lucky and worked in a team for 7+ years that was really awesome. The engineering culture was top notch and work/life balance was pretty good. Of course when we got closer to shipping, you&#039;d be working a bit more, but for the most part, I never felt pressured to do more work than I was comfortable with. I believe the pay and benefits are on par with other big tech companies. If you stick around for a while, you get a lot of vacation time.</p> 
review405: - Quality resources that you can bring to an opportunity - Office 365 and Azure will save the company over the long haul - At the end of the day - Microsoft has enough cash to buy or innovate their way to the &#034;next level&#034;</p> 
review406: The most flexible place I have ever worked, great co-workers, great experience. I made the mistake once of leaving for another company, I returned after year.</p>

review409: It&#039;s a good company to work. It&#039;s very lay back and you have a lot of liberty.</p> 
review410: Great medical and dental benefits with high importance/incentives placed on physical fitness and health. Flexible work hours means ability to take care of life&#039;s demands while still producing quality products. Performance-based bonuses rewards hard work, mentorship for career-minded individuals assists in preparing for advancement. Give program matches charitable donations of money and volunteer hours 100% up to $15,000/year.</p> 
review411: good place to join as a junior, if you work hard you will stand out of the herd and promote quickly. work life balance depends on the team too much so if you have the chance, prefer teams with applied scientists, even if you&#039;re not one. bing search relevance, bing ads, speech, and more teams... you can ask directly to the recruiter if the team is all software devs or if there are scientists too. if you want to ask indirectly, ask if the team is doing anything to improve Cortana. good comp, at least in the silicon valley.</p>

The company has many products and services to offer so there are many internal opportunities and transferring to a new team is easy. There are many opportunities to learn.</p> 
review416: Microsoft has great benefits and if you are a high performer you can be rewarded significantly. I worked in three different organizations and mostly felt like I was being paid and acknowledged as I would have expected.</p>

review425: Great Community feeling at the Company. They really want to make it a place where people are proud of the work that they do. Although they get a lot of flack for their review process, I believe that they are working to correct it.</p> 
review426: Salaries are above average as are the benefits. Work life balance is better than at other companies with similar salary.</p>

You will both learn and grow yourself professionally and technically at a much faster pace, and be exposed to many different industries and markets. Each day is a challenge but the benefits, rewards and experience awaiting you is well worth it.</p> 
review436: flexible environment, friendly colleges,good place</p> 
review437: Good offices. If you love power point that is your place. A strategy is a slide - and god bless account managers.</p> 
review438: I was fortunate to get hired on to a project with a great team for a great project. There were lots of nice little perks like free snacks in addition to the company-wide free drinks, social events with food an beer, and occasionally meals were provided. Free parking is also a plus, even if it can be tough to find a spot on Microsoft Campus. The job itself was a great experience for me and I was allowed to be self driven. After learning the ropes I generally worked on my own, but if I needed help or didn&#039;t have the solution to a problem everyone on the team was more than happy to help. Overall it was a very positive environment. I especially enjoyed being able to work directly with people in the production and design teams, which made it easier when trying to understanding intended functionality of the product.</p>

review440: Great Team and great food</p>

review444: Great co-workers, scope and benefits.</p> 
review445: It&#039;s great to work. Learning new thing is everyday business. Benefits are great. Health benefit was best couple of years ago. Not we have to pay co, but MS provides Health Savings Plan and each year they refill your credit card.</p> 
review446: If you are lucky and land up in a good team with a good manager you can do really well. Lots of learning opportunities available</p> 
review447: - Great benefits and pay - Terrific work life balance - Ability to tackle really big projects - New leadership focusing on being the best at fewer big items</p>

Field sales roles will also have the opportunity to make very good money in a not long period.</p>

review471: - Streamlined processes and tools - Tons of smart people - Great opportunities to work on exciting projects - Good work life balance and benefits</p> 
review472: Easy to move around, many teams encourage collaboration over competition. Coworkers are intelligent and dedicated. Work life balance is often up to you, and many product teams frequently have fun activities together. The CEO cares about employee&#039;s happiness as well.</p> 
review473: Microsoft has so many different products and groups that it&#039;s easy to find something you can be passionate working on. Movement around the company is pretty easy if you&#039;re doing well (you still need to interview for new positions of course), but it&#039;s possible to move between groups and divisions. Engineering processes are mature, and you can really solidify your skills there. The People and corporate culture is excellent. People are very bright, open and friendly. As with any large corporation it has it&#039;s own share of politics which you need to keep an eye on, but for the most part it&#039;s a great place to do solid, meaningful work.</p> 
review474: *Flexible hours *helpful and responsive management *Weekly meetings with managers *Management recognized the position as also a learning experience, and were willing to help in areas I didn&#039;t understand. *Was able to work on a number of different projects which I got to chose and often lead.</p>

review478: EPG has many smart and hardworking people. If you can make politics work in your favor, you will be rewarded. Good place to leave and go to the field.</p> 
review479: Fairly lax working environment and NO dress code which is very nice. I hate wearing slacks, dress shirt and dress shoes. Shorts and flip flops suit me just fine. You can&#039;t beat the benefits. I doubt that Boeing is as good as the benefits that MS provides. If you are fortunate enough to get on a team where you have a good manager who cares about their people, then you will have a GREAT experience during your time at MS.</p> 
review480: Environment, care with employee, opportunities</p> 
review481: Great company, campus&#039;, food, and office life. Good pay, benefits, and bonus&#039;</p>

review492: Empowers billions of users - great products.</p> 
review493: Great people to work with</p> 
review494: MS is a decent place to work if you can manage to get on a good team with transparent managers and stay away from office politics though this will certainly shorten your career</p> 
review495: Benefits were very good and campus was nice.</p> 
review496: Great product company to work and learn processes Has liberty to share ideas and best thing is no dress code</p> 
review496: Excellent benefits, great people, competitive salary, and the chance to work with great brands.</p>

review505: Great product company to work and learn processes Has liberty to share ideas and best thing is no dress code</p> 
review505: Great Pay. Good Benefits. Lots of internal job openings.</p> 
review506: Microsoft is flexible about when employees arrive and how to manage your own time but it&#039;s not be confused with work/life balance because you work all of the time. There are so many bright, talented and hard working people. The benefits are excellent.</p> 
review507: I have been with Microsoft for almost 23 years now and have seen the company grow, succeed, fail and reemerge. Overall it&#039;s a great company to work for with lots of talented people. Microsoft usually gets it right with benefits etc</p> 
review508: It&#039;s a great company with a lot of great benefits.</p> 
review509: Super talented and technical employees. Excellent Compensation and Benefits.</p> 
review510: - Good work-life balance, for the large groups in which I&#039;ve worked. - Plenty of opportunities to learn on the job. - Easy to move between groups when one needs a change. - Easy to find groups doing the types of work one is looking for, since the company is involved in many different areas across the industry. - The current annual review system is much improved over the past 15+ years&#039; Ballmer-era system &amp; its variations, at least with respect to one&#039;s performance rating.</p> 
review511: Awesome work. Awesome people</p> 
review512: Good work-life balance, great benefits, understanding supervisors and managers. Terrific company giving program. Clarity and transparency about the path toward advancement, though that path is very long.</p> 
review513: Great stable company with dependable work, work timings and salary with good flexibility depending on who is your manager</p>

review514: Great place to work, but still too new</p> 
review515: Great people to work with, with the occasional odd ball. Benefits are good and lots of flexibility on schedule.</p> 
review516: Great pay and benefits. Ability to carve out your space and take on challenges you want.</p> 
review517: Bottom up philosophy. Opportunity for impact through tech transfers with forward looking product groups. Opportunity to publish interesting and relevant findings, contributing to the academic community Company is becoming again very innovative and forward looking</p> 
review518: Microsoft is an exciting place to work because there is so much going on within the company. There is also great opportunities to transfer between teams if you are looking for change. The recent changes in senior leadership has also re-energized many people within the company.</p> 
review519: Process variability on project by project basis</p> 
review520: The benefit package is awesome at Microsoft</p> 
review521: health insurance, salary, people, techonolgy</p> 
review522: It really depends on which team you end up working for. I know folks that have worked in crappy teams at MS, and other folks that have worked in awesome teams. I&#039;m one of the latter. MS does take good care of its employees.</p> 
review523: MS is adapting well to the new world of cloud services. Struggling with mobile but I like our focus on cross platform support. Satya is not tied to the past but focused on the future. pay is good and benefits are top notch. work life balance is ok. lots of flexibility on work style, work from home, office on the road. great technology to support mobile workforce. People are generally great to work with and collaborate.</p>

review525: Awesome benefits, flexible work schedule, good pay</p> 
review526: Flexible time and goals, you get to work with really smart people</p> 
review527: - Salary and benefits are superb. - Lots of support for self-directed growth - they&#039;ll reimburse up to $6,000 of college tuition for any classes in any field, and you&#039;re encouraged to seek out projects or roles that specifically interest you. - &lt;i&gt;Everyone&lt;/i&gt; you work with is smart and very motivated. This isn&#039;t just the engineering department - tech support, UX design, business strategy, etc. are all staffed by people very good at their jobs. - The Online Services Division is very diverse. About 90% of our employees were born overseas, in countries ranging from Nigeria to Russia, and people are very open and curious about different cultures. I&#039;m a woman, and I&#039;ve never felt the management or my team treated me differently or respected me less. I did get some dubious comments from two of our developers (out of 40+ developers I&#039;ve worked with), but those specific people have a reputation for being abrasive with everyone.</p> 
review528: You get to work with very talented individuals from across the globe, participate in large projects and have a direct impact on the execution and results of the business</p> 
review529: Opportunities to grow, Getting back to innovation, moving to agile</p> 
review530: They are flexible in where and when you work. There are a lot of opportunities to work in a wide variety of roles.</p> 
review531: My 20 months at Microsoft were filled with a lot of learning, personal growth and development. My team (Windows Live Safety Platform) was a very energetic team with very high bars for quality and agility. I had a fantastic mentor who also happened to be one of the smartest people I&#039;ve ever worked with. While at times it did feel like the company was too big and that some decisions could be made faster, it almost always felt understandable. I heard complaints about other areas of the firm, but my own personal experience was fantastic.</p> 
review532: Great place to be if you love tech. I was in a non-technical department, but still felt up-to-date with a lot of the tech developments that were going on. Great benefits such as the 401k match, yearly fitness stipend, good compensation. Relative stability: MS isn&#039;t in danger of going bankrupt anytime soon.</p> 
review532: Work life balance, Exciting work, mentorship</p> 
review533: 10% off shares, pays 5000 a year for school even as part time, 10% off most hardware, software is even more discounted. Great community, always holding great events.</p> 
review534: Culture at Microsoft is awesome. I&#039;m sure this was biased since I was interning there but they really take care of their employees / everyone seems to be happy to be there.</p> 
review535: Compensation was good and it was clear that there was an urgency to improve business performance in the Cloud space.</p> 
review536: Talented people, good benefits and pay-package. The company is making significant changes to remain competitive for the near and long term.</p> 
review537: Microsoft treats it&#039;s people very well overall. The compensation is competitive for the Seattle area. Career development is a focus area. The review model changes over the past years have made improvements to the cutthroat nature of the culture. The number one improvement, and felt literally every day, is the naming of Satya Nadella as the CEO - much more inspired leadership that is practical to today&#039;s technology market.</p> 
review538: Great benefits and pay, stock options help too</p> 
review539: You work with a lot of smart people and typically get ahead based on your performance and nothing else. The company seems on the right track at the moment. There are a lot of opportunities to move around and the company encourages this. Benefits were fantastic a few years ago, but are still pretty good. Work is generally exciting and impactful. The review model is much better than it was..</p> 
review540: Salary and benefits were generous. Work environment was flexible and work-life balance was very manageable.</p> 
review541: company provides very competitive benefits, and there are a lot of product groups focusing in different areas. Get to work with a lot of very talented engineers from all over the world.</p> 
review541: Free drinks Free snacks Free Shuttle (redmond)</p> 
review542: great work life balance - I managed to finish my project by working 8h days, though I&#039;ve heard that sometimes fulltime employees have to work 12h+ plenty of intern events interesting projects</p> 
review543: Flexibility to do different types of work. Good benefits and pay. Diverse working environment. Many different locations.</p> 
review544: A company that rewards hard work</p>

review552: Great, smart people, great benefits. Community oriented</p> 
review553: Great place to work and wonderful atmosphere..................</p> 
review554: 1) They really took superb care of all the interns. Work load on them is as much as could be to a normal employee. 2) Great intern events</p> 
review555: great experience, awesome place to work</p> 
review556: Because of the size of the company, experiences are different in different departments. Overall it is a nice place to work with good pay, bonuses and perks.</p> 
review557: The most intelligent folks I have ever encountered. They are not only thinking and planning but they are doing. They are trying out lots of new things knowing that many of those things won&#039;t work. They are trying desperately to change their stack ranking culture to a fail smart and fast and move together culture.</p> 
review558: Azure and Office 365 - cool tech with a growing customer base.</p> 
review559: great program. You will learn a lot. Fun environment to be in.</p> 
review559: The people are very friendly</p> 
review560: Microsoft as a company is great, very innovative products.</p> 
review561: Great training process and culture. The employers not only focus on your technical skills, but on your overall behaviors.</p> 
review562: Smart people but not really. I worked at other tech companies and I think Microsoft gets more than its fair portion of sales like personalities. I think that&#039;s both good and bad. The best tech is being made here by just a handful of people but with the worst implementation cause the focus is to sell not make something great.</p> 
review563: The best reason to work at Microsoft is because of the customer service representation.</p> 
review564: it used to be one of the only premium companies to work for here in Seattle. The company provides good benefits, decent base compensation, and somewhat of a stable work-life balance depending on which group you are in (or no work-life balance at all, depending on which group you are in). Depending on the group you are in you can get tremendous job satisfaction on the product you work on, or it could be extremely boring where you are contributing to only the smallest part possible of a huge legacy product. (In other words, choose your product group well)</p> 
review565: quality people, dynamic culture, very active</p> 
review566: Amazing benefits for a U.S. company! Great 401k matching, quantity of vacation days, maternity/paternity leave, etc.</p> 
review567: Great pay and benefits, culture focused on technology and innovation, strategy not focused entirely on making profit- it has a higher mission and does amazing things to help those in need, the environment, and the community.</p>

review569: The corporate culture in Office was best place I ever worked at Microsoft. They cared very deeply about shipping great products.</p> 
review570: With Satya Nadela at the helm, Microsoft has got a clear mission, strategy and excellent product line up. Transformation to a Cloud first, Mobile first business is setting the stage for a big comeback.</p> 
review571: Work with some amazing people on software that is used by billions around the world</p> 
review572: Newer employees and even some senior ones are very nice and often just want to code. Great health benefits.</p> 
review573: Great benefits including gym membership, subsidized housing, and great (and affordable) food provided on campus.</p> 
review574: Excelent pay, Comissions, Constant Trainning, All the necesary tools, Specialist available to help you with the prospects customers and IT departments.</p> 
review575: Compensation is industry leading. Work/life balance is valued. Great co-workers. Lovely offices.</p> 
review576: They added more public holidays and generous parental leave. Work life balance is very achievable as far as tech companies goes</p> 
review577: Many different groups with their own cultures. You can most likely find something that fits you.</p> 
review577: Working as a contractor at Microsoft provides many benefits. Depending on the group, you have a lot of flexibility, great wages, and a team environment, without the politics. Contracting opens up many doors for FTE opportunities and/or other contracting positions.</p> 
review578: Tons of benefits, they definitely spoil their interns and make sure you are getting the best experience possible</p> 
review579: Great company to work for</p> 
review580: Good place to work for</p> 
review581: Great benefits, flexibility, cutting edge of technology</p> 
review582: Lots of flexibility to achieve work-life balance. If you have to leave in the middle of the day to run an errand, it&#039;s usually fine</p> 
review583: -Awesome benefits -Smart coworkers -All the resources to do your job</p> 
review584: Your peers are some of the best in the world.</p> 
review585: Good exposure if you take accountability</p> 
review586: HUGE institutional memory - access to years of problem-solving history, plus (generally) deeper info if you need it. Benefits aren&#039;t as amazing as they were a few years ago, but that means they&#039;re merely &#034;stellar&#034; now.</p> 
review586: Lot&#039;s of learning and support. Able to develop skill sets and plenty of room for growth.</p> 
review587: I interned at Microsoft Research Cambridge in UK for a summer. I liked the place a lot, my mentors were very helpful and we discuss a lot everyday. Of course there would be high expectations, but I was learning a lot also each day.</p> 
review588: Friendly team, great product, enthusiastic people! The internship program is very well structured - you have three &#034;official&#034; meetings with your manager during which you can plan out your goals, get feedback on your performance midway through the internship, etc.</p> 
review589: The best part of a Microsoft job is the opportunity to claw your way up within Microsoft. Also, Microsoft still has a long way to coast before it completely runs out of momentum.</p> 
review590: Learned a ton, and met some really great people, who end up leaving, because the culture is so toxic. Learned how to deal with highly toxic and incompetent middle managers, who are in charge of the place. I was a group manager and was shocked by how petty and calculating my peers were. Hey - but that&#039;s what we were paid to do! If you&#039;re a nasty and highly-political middle manager with no interest in customers then this is the place for you. You will stay there forever and be richly rewarded.</p> 
review591: Wide possibilities for professional development</p> 
review592: Good salary, nice bonuses for those with high security clearances. No health care premiums are take from your paycheck...YET. Definitely building a culture around diversity and clean business practices.</p> 
review593: Microsoft is going to do right by you. They will always try to do right by you. They are built to take great care of their employees. Depending on the group, you will absolutely be empowered to be the best version of yourself.</p> 
review594: I was very impressed with the quality of work @ microsoft. Cutting-edge technology, very knowledgable architects, and very smart co-workers. Needless to say, Microsoft has one of the best benefit packages in the industry.</p>

review600: Awesome company to work with. very good work life balance</p> 
review601: amazing vision and product portfolio very optimized operating model</p> 
review602: Good benefits Good career opportunities if you have a good manager who has your best interests in mind</p> 
review603: Great Employer to work for</p> 
review604: Good benefits. Lots of opportunities to move within the company.</p> 
review604: Smart people, Innovative technology, option to change the team,</p> 
review605: The people I worked with were great, company benefits were second to none, and there were flexible work schedule if you got the right manager. And depending on the role, there were meaty issues to solve and plenty to keep the mind active.</p> 
review606: A great company overall. Many good people and lots of resources to learn and grow. The projects &amp; stuff you work could be challenge but could also be very trivial and boring. Good work and life balance. Okay composition.</p> 
review607: You get to use the latest software. MS is a brand name and you get to work under MS brand.</p> 
review608: Microsoft is the best company I&#039;ve ever had the pleasure to work for. The management is intelligent, and really does try to give the employee as much success as they want. I loved the work hard play hard culture that Microsoft seems to celebrate. They are a diverse company, that really does try hard to be inclusive of everyone. The money is great, benefits are amazing.</p> 
review609: Best company ever, very low stress &amp; huge pay!</p> 
review610: Great people, awesome environment and good pay. Executives were willing to help at any time. Flexible work hours and other fringe benefits.</p> 
review611: Access to pretty much all MS software. Gives you the opportunity to learn whatever you want of their technology.</p> 
review612: Great benefits, great people, salary is above average for position, stock options, bonuses, large corporation</p> 
review613: It&#039;s great here, when you have a dedicated team and management. I&#039;ve learned that MSFT is very thorough in qualifications and has a lot of red tape-- but for good reason. 1. You&#039;re as worthy of moving up as you are dedicated. 2. You aren&#039;t going to be spoon fed opportunities to grow-- seek and you shall find. 3. Room to network and make your name out there. 4. The company actually listens to what Retail is saying and they grow with their employees. 5. They have, honestly, the /best/ coaching and constructive criticism training. I used to be an ASM at another retail company and I was honestly moved by how graceful managers are when it comes to attending to a problem and setting you up for success. 6. The pay is substantially more than other companies-- but be forewarned, with greater pay it comes with greater responsibility.</p> 
review613: Work life balance, Work hour flexibility, Compensation</p> 
review614: Great place to work for a few years, but be aggressive about pursuing your own skills, and be prepared to move on at any time.</p>

review625: Great pay! Great bonus. Ability to work remotely.</p> 
review626: It goes without saying that Microsoft has great benefits.</p> 
review627: CEO Satya Nadella has a new direction for the company, the direction is clear and employees feel good about his leadership.</p> 
review628: Satya (CEO) is helping to change the mindset of the company and making some bold moves like giving away Windows, focusing on Cloud, making Office available on Apple and Android devices etc</p> 
review629: Many groups are adopting the One Microsoft direction. Senior level management is bought in, line level (ICs) are too Competitive salary and benefits</p> 
review630: - Challenging and interesting opportunities - Pretty decent benefits</p> 
review631: Benefits are decent, although nothing like they used to be. They have some extra perks like the Prime card which allows employees and their families to get a lot of buy one get one at many restaurants as well as very low entry prices to zoos, museums, etc.</p> 
review631: Work Life, very smart people, benefits</p> 
review632: Overall a good place to work. Good Insurance and benefits</p> 
review633: I work at Microsoft headquarters in Redmond and have been with the company for 2.5 years. This is a great company to be a software developer for, and they pay well with fantastic benefits. Some teams at Microsoft are fast paced, new, and exciting. Some teams are slow moving and have tons of process. You can probably find what you are looking for at this company given the wide variety of products and teams.</p> 
review634: There are a lot of great benefits and perks. A lot of rewarding work.</p> 
review635: Working for a big employer like Microsoft is a great opportunity mainly because of their great benefits.</p> 
review636: Many opportunities to learn and to build your skill set. Opportunities to work on many different types of technology and software interfaces.</p> 
review637: Vibrant firm with very smart people.</p> 
review638: After spending nine years of my career at Microsoft, I can say without doubt that the one thing that&#039;s kept me here, is people. Building products, and solving problems for a billion people, attracts some of the brightest minds. It can be intimidating, but is almost always also exciting. Creativity and innovation is always encouraged and rewarded. Role boundaries are as flexible as you want them to be. I work with rock-star devs who live and breath hyper-scale code. Whereas I often operate in the fuzz between full stack engineering, program management, and marketing. Benefits are pretty good, once you get past the unnecessary complexity of the way they are structured. Management knows things are different now. This is not the same Microsoft as two years ago. You can almost smell the change in campus air. Speaking of smells, management&#039;s finally listening and the cafeteria food has been excellent lately.</p> 
review639: I am a new full time hire here at Microsoft. I previously interned here and have had nothing but a good experience. Flexible hours so long as you complete your work. Great compensation and benefits. Nice location.</p>

review640: Huge choice for work, (almost) top class benefits, better than average colleagues, great campus, MSR, many high impact products</p> 
review641: Smart engineering, great Executive management, really good Cloud strategy, and great benefits. Work at home is pretty common, and there are lots of places to move to when your first gig tanks.</p> 
review642: Too many to list out.</p> 
review643: Quality company creating excellent products.</p> 
review644: It has great benefits, compensation program</p> 
review645: Benefits, pay, performance opportunities, great and smart people</p> 
review646: Great place to work, never a dull moment. Fast pace and high expectations, but love to be able to always work on the latest and greatest technology with so many brilliant people.</p> 
review647: People were smart and good in a lot of ways. Early one, when Bill was in charge and the company was growing, it was a fabulous place to work. People were high energy and loved the job, the stock was growing and you did not have an up and out culture. People were valued for their work, not their career mobility, so I use to hear the phrase, the company ran on 12 (level 12&#039;s where the majority of people stayed career wise). Very few went on to management and for good reason, you don&#039;t need that many leaders.</p> 
review648: Great office and Team Free lunches</p> 
review649: Personal and professional growth potential is tremendous, corporate support of employees is outstanding, peers are of high caliber, the pay is good, the benefits are justifiably legendary. This company truly stands by their commitments to support their employees.</p>

review652: lots of smart people around, very collaborative environment within the team. We also value human connections.</p> 
review653: Nice facility, most co-workers are civil to friendly. Salaries are higher than average for the area. Contractors were great to work with.</p> 
review654: With the right manager, the ability to navigate your own growth is spot on. My ability to promote out of administrative work to something more program management oriented was seamless. Work/life balance is encouraged. Benefits are great and the stay fit benefit is an additional perk the helps reward feeling healthy overall.</p> 
review655: Great opportunities for impact, smooth integration of new employees, very smart colleagues, great perks and benefits, good work life balance.</p> 
review656: Some good teams and smart atmosphere</p> 
review657: Great pay, benefits aren&#039;t what they used to be but still are pretty good. Most managers are really good and most of the people you work with are really nice. It is the best company I have ever worked for with a pretty good review system although it is not perfect.</p> 
review658: Great people, diversity in opportunities</p> 
review658: Great pay Average benefits Brilliant people to work with and learn from Feels great to work on products that so many people use It is possible to keep working on an open source project you may contribute to, if you follow the appropriate process</p>

Very good benefits Health care, health club, ESPP, 401K, infant care, Paternity leave, good vacation, free food (in certain divisions). Microsoft has one of the best benefit package out there. Good work life balance in most divisions.</p> 
review666: The opportunity to work on such great games as Forza and Forza: Horizon was a great experience. The art teams, Vehicle Art in particular, were amazing people to work with and made coming into work everyday enjoyable. The studio had a somewhat decent cafeteria, free soft drinks/coffee/tee and if you had to work late or on weekends they brought in food.</p> 
review667: Very smart people, healthy culture, very strong market position, admired CEO, low tolerance for toxic people and non-performers</p> 
review667: Amazing company with some of the most talented and smart people on the planet. The right strategic moves are being made to keep the company growing and remain competitive. Technology innovation at its best!</p> 
review668: * Great benefits * Great Salary * Great People</p> 
review669: Worked in Microsoft Consulting Services. Lots of opportunities to learn, company very focused on customer satisfaction. Very interesting assignments. Lots of responsibility thrown at you from the first day of work. Overall, I recommend the company.</p>

Nearly unlimited software access, and a wide variety of resources and training to help you build technical solutions that improves your job effectiveness and efficiency. Transportation using shuttles with wifi to and from your neighborhood. Guaranteed rides home via taxi if you miss your bus.</p> 
review677: Enough smart people to learn from. Lots of interesting projects to choose from. Decent work-life balance and flexible schedule. Good for building career in long-term.</p> 
review678: Benefits - pro club, decent medical, dental, vision, 401K is good, holidays wide range of work to do, complex problems to solve, lots to learn</p> 
review679: Large diverse company with enough budget and support to pull off anything</p> 
review680: Solid company when times get tough, varied product line allowing for internal moves, decent compensation, some really fine people. The new CEO has a good vision for the company, though he&#039;ll have an uphill battle.</p> 
review681: Positive change happening under Satya&#039;s leadership. More agile. More focused on product metrics.</p> 
review682: Great benefits, great pay, awesome campus facilities and really smart coworkers. You work at a company which is one of the top 3-4 technology firms in the world. There is pride in that. I also like how the company evolves its benefits to care for its employees&#039; needs. For an engineer there are opportunities to work across the stack from productivity software, cloud, gaming to operating systems. The company cares about work/life balance.</p> 
review683: If you work really hard and make the right people like you, you might be one of the lucky few who get selected for BENCH/HiPo/Lab365, which is the fast-track to promotions, bonuses, and raises. Even if you don&#039;t, compensation is still pretty good.</p> 
review684: Great potential for evolution inside the company.</p> 
review685: There are so many opportunities and you can work in almost any field with any audience on so many great products.</p> 
review685: Microsoft has suffered for many years, but it is on the turn around since Nadella took over. he is working hard to earn the trust and respect of everyone.</p> 
review686: You learn from the best of the best - and if you are in the right group - you learn from each other.</p> 
review687: Microsoft has all kinds of possibilities in all kinds of disciplines, so it&#039;s little wonder they attract as many people as they do. And if you&#039;re working contract and find a staffing agency with any sort of testicles, they pay very fairly.</p> 
review688: Great benefits, good pay, fun environment,</p> 
review689: Laid back environment, good company to work for, the experience you gain, so many people to work with that have amazing talent</p> 
review690: The compensation is fair and as a contract employee it is easy to move around the company to experience different organizations. Having a limit on contract hours is pretty great, a hard stop at 40 hours is a relief during peak seasons.</p> 
review691: great place to work and amazing for work-life balance</p> 
review692: 401k, paid vacation and sick time.</p> 
review693: typical old large company. Benefits are OK, not on par with Google/LinkedIn/Facebook etc. A lot of super smart people. Some of them are pleasure to work with. Some are just a**. The team was great . The dev manager and low level managers are also building new features and coding a lot. So they understand the product very well. There are some struggling to keep competitive in the market, but everything was smooth and effective. Work/Life balance was OK (not anymore in some teams).</p> 
review694: Microsoft is a great company. Free drinks and cheap food at a great cafeteria. Unlimited resources, pretty much any kind of project you want to work on and a lot of mobility within the company. Opportunities all over the world. The new management really gets what needs to happen and it feels like the company is going in the right direction. There are some great people at Microsoft.</p>

review716: Massive positive culture change in past year - focus on agility, breaking down org silos, utilizing open source. Encouraging more small team projects, but trying to cut out legacy products/teams that are no longer relevant or draining the company. Very good benefits, managers can be good or bad (like any large company). Move away from the bad ones and find the good ones. Dropping stack ranking was a huge improvement.</p>

review746: Good compensation and good benefits package</p> 
review747: The interview went great. I was hired on the spot. And that&#039;s fast for Microsoft. I have a sense of accomplishment knowing I was hired because all of Microsoft&#039;s H1-B workers couldn&#039;t do the job I&#039;m doing. People are polite, even if they tend to be somewhat passive aggressive in the way people from Redmond, Bellevue, WA can be. And that&#039;s kind of where the pros stop. The only other bright side so far - I won&#039;t be here longer than five years I&#039;m sure. Which is good, because in IT, anyone who has been at Microsoft more than five years is &#034;damaged goods&#034; on the job market.</p> 
review748: depends on the group your working in... i worked at msft for over 20 years. i liked it better in the old days.</p>

review756: I get to work on some meaty projects that affect our customer base. Definitely have a lot of autonomy to make the work happen (but there are issues here too... see below). The people are all very smart and, for the most part, enjoyable to work with. Amazing work life balance.</p> 
review757: good pay and good benefits</p> 
review757: If you are lucky to join a good team, you work with amazing people on amazing products</p> 
review758: Benefits, training, career growth are wonderful. Also, your annual increase is based upon how you have helped others, how you have learned from others, how you have helped Microsoft grow, and if a consultant, your utilization. They truly put effort towards giving everyone an opportunity to grow and excel. Constant visibility to corporate direction - town halls, etc. New CEO has made a real difference from what I hear from long-term employees.</p>

This was unheard of in the Silicon Valley tech companies where I had worked. I worked hard there and believe that my work was adequately recognized and appreciated. They treat their employees really well. It was pretty hard for me to leave in spite of having a number of solid reasons for doing so. Why? I got so comfortable. It&#039;s true.

review1213: Great benefits, good work environment</p> 
review1214: I have joined as a L59 and left an L61. Big PROS are: - (if you&#039;re lucky) having a good manager who can guide you up the career ladder and broaden your horizons - smart-ass people. You CAN learn every day, if you want to learn. - good compensation benefits (until idiots who dialed 911 just for a simple scratch forced MS into introducing co-payments for benefits).</p>

review1226: Great opportunities to move around and grow.</p> 
review1227: There are some really great engineers you can work with. Contradictory to many beliefs, I still think Microsoft has above average engineers. The question is how they can be utilized better in a system that did not have good management.</p> 
review1228: * Good work life balance * Good work culture</p> 
review1229: Great benefits, can now move around to find the right team *as long as you don&#039;t have bad reviews*. Huge resources and can work on projects that ship to the world.</p>

review1231: I am wanting to start a full time Network Engineering career.</p> 
review1232: Having a good manager is very important, meaning someone who leads technically while also supporting you to take on challenges. Working with very smart people is a plus. If you don&#039;t like the current org structure, just wait 6 months, it will change.</p> 
review1233: Great place to work. Too many interns.</p> 
review1234: Good benefits, flexible timing to work, few hardcore geeks here and there who are loyal to core making things moving in right direction.</p>

review1240: Every day I&#039;m energized coming to work! Been here 10+ years and love it</p> 
review1241: Foundation - Microsoft is a great place to learn and to explore. Sure, the first year of employment, you&#039;ll be trying to figure out our process around planning, developing, testing, code reviews, checking in code, opening bugs, tracking bugs to builds, build process, talking to others in a &#039;diplomatic&#039; manner but you&#039;ll learn how software is delivered and be able to articulate it. Microsoft is good at formalizing workflows which is good if you&#039;ve never worked with a large team. You&#039;ll think of things from security, efficiency, even variable and method names (for public APIs), they have a team dedicate to reviewing and teaching you. Structure - If you&#039;re a fan of process and structure, there&#039;s a lot. Some people hate it, but if you ask &#034;why?&#034; instead of complain, you&#039;ll often see a reason and if not, you can always find ways to improve it. Movement - Microsoft is huge and work on many things. The benefit of being able to transfer teams to learn new things is amazing. I started working at Microsoft on the front end of some silly application that no longer exists, a year later, I was working on the kernel drivers of their embedded platform. Security - You&#039;ll always be able to pay your bills. There&#039;s only ever been one layoff in my 9 years at Microsoft that has shocked me. Benefits are spectacular. Flexible - as structured as the process goes, managers are always willing to be flexible on hours. It&#039;s great for life balance as the demand of life outside of work changes - new parents, family health issues. When my child was born I would be out at 4:30 and work remotely after my kid was in bed. Every team at Microsoft varies on the structure and culture, something will usually fit you.</p>

review1250: Challenging and I like that a lot</p> 
review1251: - A very stimulating experience for learning and growing - As an established company, they have a way to bring people to a certain level which is valuable to novices to the industry - Their standard is high, when you manage that, it typically makes you confident for other opportunities in younger companies, or comfortable to grow with the company - The company seems to experience some positive changes heading sound directions</p>

Many of the people I&#039;ve worked with are the same. The pay is good, the benefits are on par with the industry and it&#039;s generally easy to move into new roles if you&#039;d like to.</p> 
review1274: - Solid pay. - Okay benefits (used to be better) and perks. Little stuff, like cell phone plan discounts, or really cheap personal shipping. - Work with smart people on cool stuff (depending on team). - Potentially broad impact.</p>

review1276: Great products and services and awesome people. Exciting environment for a technologist, always something new. Breadth of products and services creates interesting opportunities for a resourceful individual to close deals. Compensation and benefits are second to none. Lots of opportunities for recognition.

review1297: As an ATS I get to be in a position to lead sales efforts over multiple years with assigned accounts. This allows me to be strategic and build great rapport and relationships with my accounts key stakeholders. I&#039;m less motivated by whatever is happening this quarter because my eyes are on a future state. Great job to be technical, consultative, business acumen is a must, and your ability to lead/collaborate with the account manager. I love it!</p>

review1298: Microsoft is a good company to work for. Very socially responsible. Benefits has reduced over the years, however, they are still comparable to the industry. Recent CEO change has been perceived positive by employee which is a good thing.</p> 
review1299: Disclaimer: I realize the experience in Microsoft could be very division/team dependent, specifically I&#039;m writing mostly for Azure and Bing. 1) Microsoft still does great tech., whole company emphasize on tech. and engineering first for the most the time (remember what Ballmer used to say at Microsoft conference). So you can end up with a resume doing cutting edge techs., but how much the industry cares about that when you walk out is dependent. 2) Microsoft is a great place to educate junior people, imo better than most of the &#034;on your own&#034; companies. Your career binds to a tech lead as junior people if he&#039;s technically strong (what supposed to be for most of time), you can improve a lot on how to do engineering. As a junior after 2-3 years in Microsoft with a right team you can be technically stronger than Google or Facebook made due to reasons above. 3) Company generally be nice for employees, they don&#039;t have good benefits like Facebook does but they do have comparable perks not including free food. For example they have legal insurance and ESPP which I found missing in Google or Facebook. Also they have free drink on quality/variance more or less the same about Google. Also I found their legal team (mostly for international employees) much more supportive/professional in general. 4) Some recent move make me think they are about to find some ways. But in general the moving slow pattern I mentioned below may prevent it from making them happen.</p>

review1309: Good person in new CEO in Satya Good benefits Job security (... mostly) Reasonable work-life balance (depending of the team / project and your ability to work smart) Reasonable mix of talents with people to learn from Good company for your 2nd job in your career if you can get in. Ok-company for graduates at the cost of been brain-washed; you will need time to re-learn reality when you get out of the Microsoft bubble. Bad company late in your career - recruiters do not value your industry experience; internal idiosyncrasy of senior review will take you time to learn and get used to if at all; expect 80% politics and 20% real work.</p>

review1323: Compensation and work-life balance are pretty decent.</p> 
review1324: Microsoft has been constantly evolving in the 11 years I&#039;ve been here. But up until now it seemed disjointed. Now we are building great software again. There are some people who just don&#039;t get it and seem to hide in the large company and resist change. However I think some of these people will not last the transformation. The culture is really favoring the agile, the entrepreneurial, the team. I like how Satya has started from day 1 with his vision and mission. Some still don&#039;t fully listen and internalize what he is saying, sticking rather to old habits. Great people to work with, great leadership, and a vision that will set trends in tech for the next 20 yrs. You can really build a career here.</p>
