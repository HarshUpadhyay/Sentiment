review1: Brand on Your Resume: After many years of losing market share and struggling to be at the front end of innovation and the fact that there&#039;s 90,000 employees, don&#039;t think MSFT is necessarily going to be attractive on your resume to more agile and smaller companies. Managing Your Career: Make you say this out loud so it registers - 90,000 employees work there. Double that for vendors. It is VERY hard to &#034;stand out&#034; and move up in the company. Don&#039;t expect your manager to be much of an advocate or enabler to help you meet your career goals - they are basically trying to survive the stack rank every year too. Not familiar with the stack rank? Check out the 2012 Vanity Fair article called &#034;Microsoft&#039;s Lost Decade&#034;.</p> 
review2: 1) Competition is fierce 2) Do not have a clear promotional path 3) not a good place for innovative people</p> 
review3: Some established processes are not conforming with industry standards. Makes it too much of a closed environment. Silos are also hard to break. Middle management is always in competition.</p> 
review4: - There is some politics from mid-level up (quite a lot). This affects everybody because it results in teams being realigned, moved around, competing projects etc. - Company has the two cash cows struggling. Windows ecosystem (outside cloud) is disappearing and Office has some stiff competition. But they are trying to do the right thing - Company is still recovering from the huge mishandling of the mobile presence (the Nokia deal, the Windows Phone OS going noewhere, etc.)</p> 
review5: Finding a good work-life balance can be challenging. 45 hour work-weeks are normal, and exceeding that is not atypical. Email is very much a part of the company culture, and it can consume large portions of your workday if you don&#039;t have a sold strategy for managing it.</p> 
review6: If you&#039;re a high-performer looking to work harder and grow faster, this company probably isn&#039;t for you. Microsoft is many smart people behaving below their intellect -- this seems to be rooted in poor accountability and a failure to reward meaningful business outcomes and discourage meaningless ones. Likely on account of its size, the company struggles to manage employee performance and cultivate genuine leadership talent in mid and senior levels of the company; it&#039;s just to easy for non-contributors to blend in.</p> 
review7: Still using old technologies and kind of slow development</p> 
review8: Twice a year employee performance rating system.</p> 
review9: Benefits not as good as before in 2010....Kathleen Hogan has made great improvements since she started re longer maternity benefits and extra holidays!</p> 
review10: I haven&#039;t had any serious difficulties or experienced any negative side to working with the company. My role was as an outside consultant so my interaction with various organizations within the company was limited, but whatever contact experience I had was positive.</p>

review16: I haven&#039;t had any serious difficulties or experienced any negative side to working with the company. My role was as an outside consultant so my interaction with various organizations within the company was limited, but whatever contact experience I had was positive.</p> 
review17: The company is in transition wrt culture, product focus, and management style, which can lead to some gaps between what is said and done.</p> 
review18: It&#039;s tech, and tech has become increasingly unsettled. Management at all levels makes decisions that don&#039;t make any sense, and have lead to an increasing atmosphere of uncertainly for employees. I&#039;m back as a contractor now (in 2016) and the general feeling is of a place where people are waiting for the other shoe to drop.</p> 
review19: Nothing really specific to the position or company, really just normal retail job downside. Working weekends and holidays like Black Friday but that is about it.</p> 
review19: - Benefits aren&#039;t what they used to be - Pay is stagnant, can make considerably more outside of MS - There&#039;s still plenty of boy&#039;s club mgmt circles that exclude outsiders regardless of experience or success</p> 
review20: Bureaucracy, execs tinker with comp plan year after year to make it harder to earn OTE for sales roles. Hyper-political. Comp is below market.</p> 
review21: Need to bring more jobs to the east coast.</p> 
review22: Some people are frustrated with the small scope of what they work on or the slow pace but I think that&#039;s just a symptom of the size and complexity of the projects you work on at Microsoft</p> 
review23: bonus is not very good comparing to other companies. Locking period 5 years</p> 
review24: Review model sucks, bonuses are underbudgeted, harder than it should be to move to a new team</p> 
review25: too much politics, stock not that good, salary below average</p> 
review26: vertical growth is very slow. Use internal proprietary tools and sometimes languages, therefore it doesn&#039;t help when seeking job outside.</p> 
review27: Too much overhead for established products/services and not enough on new ones. Satya is pushing new cultural expectations though there is some disconnect from him down to the folks doing the work. Middle management tiers need to catch up or need to focus on the business rather than themselves. Some employees that are successful in a role can get stuck there if no one else can fill in. They can get pulled back into those areas throughout their career to bail others out.</p> 
review28: Easy to be complacent, and later irrelevant. Don&#039;t stay in one place too long. Don&#039;t settle for a bad manager.</p>

review30: Easy to be complacent, and later irrelevant. Don&#039;t stay in one place too long. Don&#039;t settle for a bad manager.</p> 
review31: In some areas still there is lot of overhead carried from earlier microsoft culture.</p> 
review32: No free food, heavy middle management.</p> 
review33: small chance to become fulltime employee</p> 
review34: Not many I can think of</p> 
review35: Needs to become more agile and forget old management technics.</p> 
review36: Windows seems like a really slow org of getting things done. I haven&#039;t seen it in my org, but there is bureaucracy at higher levels.</p> 
review37: big company, slow to change</p> 
review37: Satellite office has lower number of interesting projects compared to HQ</p> 
review38: Too many developers and too large of a company in general. Everything takes a long time,</p> 
review39: Your success depends on team\manager.</p> 
review40: A very cut-throat environment, sink or swim. If you do great work AND &#034;manage up&#034;, you are good. If you do a mediocre job and manage up, you are OK, too. Don&#039;t manage up or play the many internal games and politics, you are toast.</p> 
review41: Too many levels at the company and no clear path on how to climb up the career ladder.</p> 
review42: You have to spend personal time to keep learning.</p> 
review43: Sometimes bureaucratic. Often competitive Old guard stuck in a rut,blocking movement and growth of others.</p> 
review44: Sometimes the work load can effect the work / home life balance. The cost of living in the Redmond/Seattle area is pretty high, compared to the rest of the country.</p> 
review45: The company is way too big and much of your time is spent in pointless meetings. each team differs though.</p> 
review46: Internal competition, lack of enthusiasm, lots of politics, a general perception that merit is not valued and cannot give you a career.</p> 
review46: Be prepared to work hard!</p> 
review47: Aggressive environment. Competetive. Less work life balance in some groups.</p> 
review48: The right role isn&#039;t the single determining factor to your individual success. It&#039;s a gigantic corporate enterprise at the end of the day. Personal job satisfaction and success may be an isolated experience that doesn&#039;t necessarily translate across every group and org at the company</p> 
review49: No downsize although there are too many employees so you might feel like you don&#039;t make a huge impact event though you do. Haven&#039;t been working here for long so I can&#039;t really say.</p> 
review50: no clear career path, lack of communication between colleagues</p> 
review51: Some divisions are very political. Dog eat dog/winner take all mentality. Some execs detached from reality.</p> 
review52: Many duties can be boring. You have to &#034;pay your dues&#034; before you can work on interesting things.</p> 
review53: You need to manage your own career rigorously since the leadership has varying levels of experience and capability to provide guidance for a long career arc. Individual contributors who don&#039;t go into a management track might eventually run into dead-ends.</p> 
review54: All awesome - no constructive fdbk needed for this entrepreneurial group!</p> 
review55: Collaboration between other teams handling other products, but part of support or associated with support, is challenging due to internal rules, regulations and policies. But our management is always willing and has been able to help bridge those gaps based on feedback. Work in progress.</p>

But our management is always willing and has been able to help bridge those gaps based on feedback. Work in progress.</p> 
review58: Change in culture is still in progress. Still many managers who provide little value but have insulated themselves and aren&#039;t going anywhere any time soon.</p> 
review59: base salary is a little low</p> 
review60: Working on all MS products after a while makes it harder for you to move to other companies that use non MS products.</p> 
review61: Last generation software dev methodologies which reduce speed (putting work in improving). Tribal knowledge without good documentation.</p> 
review62: It is becoming another cold company lacking care of its employees.</p> 
review63: Some teams can be less work/life balance friendly, however I&#039;ve found that most are good. I&#039;m just ready for something different.</p> 
review64: Not Much Structure, rude customers, hours, people thinking it&#039;s the apple store</p> 
review64: Constant re-orgs Sometimes it&#039;s difficult to understand why senior leadership make the decisions that they make Several of my coworkers are at a very comfortable stage in life and don&#039;t aspire much for their career</p> 
review65: Lots of judgement, no one appreciated me for me, I felt like I was abandoned for the most part.</p> 
review66: Career development at Microsoft can be a bit challenging as the company has almost no internal trainings and very little sponsorship for external trainings. All you can do is peer modeling and public events where PR is more than Tech stuff.</p> 
review67: bureaucracy, placement is never guaranteed</p> 
review68: Political environment with managers who know little to nothing of the true work effort. Those who brown nose get noticed and rewarded, while those who do the actual work are overlooked. Metrics driven.</p> 
review69: Long hours, suburbia campus, boring for young people.</p> 
review70: Pay is okay compare to Amazon and other company, lot&#039;s of up and down due to re-org</p> 
review71: 1. Mid Level Management Politics is a downer 2. Lot of Internal teams are competitive with each other rather than joining forces to compete with outsiders</p> 
review72: High stress, heavy workload, work/life balance</p> 
review73: Micro-management, yearly review process makes no sense for retail environment.</p> 
review73: It is still a fairly political place to work and advancing as you get higher up is more about who knows you than the actual output of your work. If you live in Seattle the commute to Redmond is still a pain regardless of the fact that they provide transportation.</p> 
review74: There are many naïve people out there that still see Microsoft as Micro$oft, the money hungry corporate giant that wants to take over the world. As a result I have seen these types of people discredit the advice of subject matter experts simply because they work at Microsoft. This is more of an nuisance than anything.</p> 
review75: Too many people working single modules.</p> 
review76: should be part of smaller teams</p> 
review77: The work load is tough</p> 
review78: Do not feel valued as employee for 15 years Managers hands are tied with curved review structure</p> 
review79: I have four managers over 2 years: too many re-organizations: too many pri·ma don·na in key management spots</p> 
review80: Chaotic, highly political, too much of process-oriented,</p> 
review81: Less opportunities to grow unless you know how to get promoted. Too many re-orgs causes constantly changing managers =&gt; whatever you deliver in a project gets lost with the last manager and you have to &#034;prove yourself&#034; again!</p> 
review82: Long-term employees are not very motivated or brilliant. Politics between business units is intense and back-biting is common.</p> 
review82: The contract employee policy makes it hard to love working there - knowing you&#039;re going to get kicked out soon.</p> 
review83: Big corporation with everything that comes with it</p> 
review84: This is for Society not Microsoft. but the benefits really need some help</p> 
review85: The Rating sucks big time</p> 
review86: Pay, no und. I loved the culture but notice it is beginning to fade away and sadly is turning into a best buynegation and set pay hourly which is hard to move aro</p> 
review87: The company is very large and oftentimes has a lot of bureaucracy. It can sometimes be hard to break through this.</p> 
review88: Work life balance may not be the best.</p> 
review89: Competition inside the company is a real deal... Because others are putting so many extra night/weekend hours, it&#039;s easy to give the impression that you&#039;re slacking just because you&#039;re doing a good job in the &#034;expected&#034; business hours</p> 
review90: No compensation benefit for contract worker like me and Terrible Traffic everyday</p> 
review91: Very high expectations from each division</p> 
review91: Large company so sometimes difficult receiving recognition for accomplishments.</p> 
review92: Growth is iffy. Depends on the project and if you are able to navigate well with company politics. Review system is the worst.</p> 
review93: Some org still uses old technology which might be 5y behind the industry. Re-org always happens and the layoff becomes new common.</p> 
review94: Not all groups work in the same way as management thinks</p> 
review95: Very Redmond eccentric, not real operations or career options outside Product and business strategy changing and thus impacting to work and employees Cross organization and business area friction, not much collaboration Microsoft is very bureaucratic, including the HR and how it treats employees Microsoft can do several billion dollar investments and write it down few years later, and impacting heavily all who worked for it, proof that the company is lost with the direction</p> 
review96: Different teams really vary a lot. You have to re-interview if you want to go to a new team</p> 
review97: Not a great marketing warehouse , lot of improvements required</p> 
review98: Microsoft is going through a transition and so things such as software quality assurance and verification as well as build systems and processes are still in flux.</p> 
review99: Can be stressful, especially if you&#039;re just starting out as a new college hire. Once you get over the initial year it becomes much more comfortable.</p> 
review100: Some teams have heavy politics</p> 
review100: Not a data-driven company; more subjective. Advancement is based on both relationships and merit, but more so on relationships.</p> 
review101: Deadlines and fire drills around month end, and midyear review.</p> 
review102: big company management issues, easy to leave</p> 
review103: Difficult to get a job in the product group if you don&#039;t live in the Seattle area.</p> 
review104: Broad and competing focus &amp; priorities Old guard slowing progress at times</p> 
review105: Current senior management like layoff a lot.</p> 
review106: Work life balance can be intense; especially as the roles can be highly matrix along with global scope so constant churn of emails, meetings, etc.</p> 
review107: bad mangment need new mangment</p> 
review108: There have been some bad practices regarding bonuses and promotions. While there have been some efforts to correct them, but i&#039;ve heard stories about some of those bad practices still persisting in some parts of the company. I personally don&#039;t experience it.</p> 
review109: Because of Microsoft&#039;s size, the quality of group managers varies greatly. Unless you know someone in the group before you join it, you just have to take your chances.</p> 
review109: Old facilities, old guard folks, but Satya is changing that. Lots of lifers who don&#039;t hustle. Lots of focus on politics, instead of the market.</p> 
review110: Senior levels (partner and above) need to be cleaned out...leadership is territorial, do not put business needs first. Having opinions and stating them when contrary to current approach is not fostered, and is often detrimental your career</p> 
review111: very repetitive, every day is pretty much the same.</p> 
review112: highly political, achievement means becoming a player which perpetuates the madness, numerous monthly compliance activities to which compliance i more important than absorbing the message. massive hierarchy very petty administrative bureaucracy</p> 
review113: * Can be very political - networking is essential to succeed in the company * Very much Corp driven. If you have a field role, it is very executional and you are very dependent on Corp. There&#039;s not much room for strong creativity. * No clear path to getting promoted. A lot of lateral moves.</p> 
review114: Cut throat environment, politics are obscene. Life expectancy of a mid level employee is very short. Strong not invented here problem. Definitely three classes of employees, old timers, young new hires, mid career new hires and there is class warfare. The IT group is definitely the red headed step child.</p> 
review115: Very large (100k+ employees), bureaucratic, slow, political, lots of A-type personalities with huge egos.</p> 
review116: Too much politics depending on the team.</p> 
review117: There are no downsides.There are no downsides There are no downsidesThere are no downsides.</p> 
review118: Microsoft is an island in the technology space</p> 
review118: The culture fosters and rewards emotionally abusive behavior from far too many middle managers.</p> 
review119: Work Life Balance doesn&#039;t exist, Lack of engagement with contractors- you are truly a separate work force</p> 
review120: Compensation package is relative low compared with other IT companies.</p> 
review121: none ..... ..... .... ..... ...... .....</p> 
review122: Can get a little bit boring since there&#039;s not enough diversity.</p> 
review123: Very fast paced environment. A great deal of information to constantly keep up with and retain to conduct your business.</p> 
review124: The job can feel little thankless. an industry hire can feel a little left out when compared to a college hire. College hire are treated differently and compensated differenrly.</p> 
review125: No direct access to product group</p> 
review126: political, too many cooks in the kitchen slowing the growth</p> 
review127: The teams can become too big and lack the ability to move quicker.</p> 
review127: The time consumed performing iterative, documentation-focused HR tasks is a burden to management and takes away from one&#039;s ability to focus on and drive their business. The manager feedback process is flawed, as low performers can torpedo a manager&#039;s rating as &#034;payback&#034; for an open and honest review. The review process also pits peers against one another - whether overtly or covertly - and this interferes with true cross-group collaboration.</p> 
review128: Stack ranking was a disaster. I understand from my friends still there that the review process has gotten better.</p> 
review129: At the drop of a hat you may be required to work past your normal shift because the management here cannot seem to staff appropriately. There is also now an unwritten rule that they must have 5% turn over every review cycle. So even though your team is understaffed you may notice that they will fire someone which goes to the whole scared at any time you will lose your job just because of this stupid rule.</p> 
review130: low pay, not many opportunities for advancement, low staffed and high volume</p> 
review131: Management, worried about kingdoms/ego rather then doing what is right</p> 
review132: I miss to &#034;start up&#034; atmosphere.</p> 
review133: There are still some managers that have been there a long time that work in the old style dictating what they want done but they&#039;re getting fewer and fewer and the constant review by everyone else at their level is making it more difficult for them.</p> 
review134: Difficult to stay on top of the ever changing review process and build long-term success unless you have a great relationship with your manager.</p> 
review135: Brand on Your Resume: After many years of losing market share and struggling to be at the front end of innovation and the fact that there&#039;s 90,000 employees, don&#039;t think MSFT is necessarily going to be attractive on your resume to more agile and smaller companies. Managing</p> 
review136: it&#039;s a big company, so it can be challenging to find a clear carrier path</p> 
review136: - too many vendors working in every project to bring down cost - challenging because you are generally working on multiple projects at a time</p> 
review137: There is a lot of special attention towards the FTEs, which is really important, I do understand. But, I wish vendors could be included in the big campus events more often so vendors do not feel excluded.</p> 
review138: Organization still somewhat silo&#039;d across divisions and key functions which puts unnecessary stain on collaboration.</p> 
review139: The hours are grueling. There is not good work life balance. If you don&#039;t mind giving up a work life balance then this is a good job for you. Keep in mind this is retail though. Half of management is great the other half...not so much.</p> 
review140: Getting anything done is near impossible because of the red tape.</p> 
review141: - Moving between teams is basically restarting the process. - The place you work on is heavily dependent on the management. - The review process is not ideal</p> 
review142: Lots of continuous management restructuring. Sometimes it is hard to keep a boss long enough to even built a proper report.</p> 
review143: Despite an overhaul of the Annual review process last year, it is still very broken and continues to pit everyone against each other which causes lots of bad behavior. HR tries to claim it doesn&#039;t, but everyone knows that it does. It also remains very subjective and the whole process lacks integrity. In fact, I believe that broken review process is the number one problem across Microsoft.</p> 
review144: Politics Benefits package is not what it used to be</p> 
review145: The biggest negative of Microsoft is it&#039;s size. Plus processes come in way and things move slower than ideal</p> 
review145: Microsoft is the fabulously wealthy company that squanders every opportunity to meaningfully change the world: losing out on the self-driving car; Internet search; the iPod; smart phones and tablets, social media — a company whose derivative and copycat products the world uses only because we *have* to, not because we love to. The commute to Redmond can be an atrocious time-investment and working from home is cultural discouraged; peak time Connector shuttles are almost always overbooked and the company touts them but doesn&#039;t run enough buses. Many managers in power are piranhas and sharks who learned how to survive the much-loathed Stack Ranking system (read Vanity Fair&#039;s 2012 article, &#034;Microsoft: The Lost Decade&#034; for full details of the HR system that shaped Microsoft culture).</p> 
review146: Microsoft has had many of the key talent leave in recent months. This has caused a panic environment in those who has been in the company for less amount of time. Sr. Management has not addressed these type of departures. Place can be very politic</p> 
review147: Many layers to go through to switch divisions or relocate</p> 
review148: 100k+ people. Lot&#039;s of politics, particularly in Redmond. Lots of people can say no, sometimes is unclear who can actually say yes and has the resources to implement. Opportunities to advance are limited (career velocity has slowed down a lot). Career mobility has also slowed down as moving from group to group seems harder</p> 
review149: Work quality may not always be that great</p> 
review150: No upward mobility to speak of, boring company. Lack of communication between departments. Currently, I feel like I have all the negatives of heavy responsibility, and very few of the benefits.</p> 
review151: sometimes the atmosphere can be quite toxic, due to overzealous FTEs, or power sucking EA&#039;s</p> 
review152: politics, low effiency, technology you learn here is less likely to be used outside</p> 
review153: Non that I can think of.</p> 
review154: No cons that I noticed.</p> 
review154: No cons that I noticed.</p> 
review155: Politics Old guard holds hard Some of the classic product groups still think like pre-web days</p> 
review156: Too mnay layers, lot of people not making real contribution</p> 
review157: There is really nothing to complain about.</p> 
review158: no room for advancement, not treated very well by corporation, constantly turning over employees and management</p> 
review159: Work priorities are based on who asked for it and who yells the loudest. Every idea no matter how bad is assigned a project team and is worked as critical. There&#039;s very little planning or forethought to anything before it&#039;s started so there&#039;s lot of throw-away work. People change jobs internally so often that there&#039;s very few experts and the same mistakes are repeated by new people. The expectation is that you have to lead something external from your core job function or you won&#039;t be recognized.</p> 
review160: The office space is constricting and a bit suffocating. Cubicles are utilized rather small offices typically split by two people.</p> 
review161: Lack of communication, low career progress</p> 
review162: Lots of layers of management, meetings, status updates, etc. Some people are trying to change the culture, but the gravity is strong. Microsoft is still a big company, and is trying to figure out how to enact new ways of thinking and executing internally. Most people in management have been there for a while, and they do not have incentive to challenge the status quo. In addition to that, being a remote location, means less options and teams to move to.</p> 
review163: Be open-minded and be ready to be in a very competitive place. Changes are constantly happening with the new culture. So get out of your comfort zone.</p> 
review163: Definitely a lot of hierarchy and internal politics, but not unlike any other company. Competitive nature could be hard for some people.</p> 
review164: Felt really far removed from Corporate. Sometimes goals seemed unattainable due to resellers. Track to promotion was not clearly defined. After a number of stores were announced the culture decreased</p> 
review165: Can&#039;t think of any reslkt</p> 
review166: Lots of levels/virtual teams to work through</p> 
review167: FTE leadership and management lacks vision. Petty politics, infighting and now most contracts being awarded to Tata Consultancy Services to bring in cheap H-1B Visa Indian workers to replace long time local middle class workers. Not going to go well in the long run with the new 18 month limit on vendors. This will cost MS brain drain of vendors who have been with the company for many years.</p> 
review168: Some hold over from outdated corporate practices which are mainly getting better. Some of the buildings are outdated.</p> 
review169: Salary is not great. Some teams have on call on weekends</p> 
review170: Teams can be slow to react to changes in the business, this can make for some hectic days until staffing catches up. Company has a &#034;healthy attrition&#034; standard meaning that managers have to always have a certain number of employees ready to be let go if upper management decides that a team is too large. This hurts the culture and makes for a bit of distrust amongst team members as they try not to be the one to get put into this category.</p> 
review171: Often culturally dysfunctional; too many wasteful meetings; company does not acquire well; mid to upper level management culture is frequently arrogant and out of touch</p> 
review172: Sometimes very difficult to obtain cross-product assets between studios.</p> 
review172: Bureaucracy, since getting something approved can take many levels before a decision gets made. Collaboration between teams can be hard if incentives or objectives aren&#039;t aligned.</p> 
review173: Career growth as a women is terrible. I see my coworkers get promoted and get told &#034;bogus&#034; reasons why I don&#039;t get promoted when I work in more impactful projects and do more work than my male peers.</p> 
review174: There is too much ambiguity. In under a year my team had three managers and they all changed our metrics so much that the focus of the job changed as well. The onboarding team should really be a FTE role and not vendor, so you&#039;re doing hard work but not getting the comparable pay or benefits of a Microsoft Employee.</p> 
review175: The company is very large and hard to navigate, it is tough to get things done quickly as there are so many people involved and a lot of red tape.</p> 
review176: In the last few years they cancelled the Annual Meeting at Safeco Field, the annual company picnic and the no-copay health insurance among others. They also got rid of SDETs (QA role)</p> 
review177: Constant moving of offices and space due to re-orgs</p> 
review178: Some division is slow on turn around so It&#039;s not good to stay on a position for long time (like more than 2 years?) unless you bet on stay here for entire career life without been laied-off</p> 
review179: Very Redmond/Seattle centric organization where opportunities in Boston are more limited to some engineering roles and sales.</p> 
review180: Lacks organization somewhat and leaders do not engage/train new resources appropriately.</p> 
review181: Incompetent middle management that has lost touch with the ground level ICs. Lots of money to throw around on bad PM ideas (supporting those ideas instead of culling at a initial level itself). means bad designs and that often doesnt work well end to end.</p> 
review181: Management and politics, it isn&#039;t what you do but who likes you that is what is important</p> 
review182: -Politics -Pace of work and learning is slower than usual standards</p> 
review183: Type A personality is viewed as better</p> 
review184: Always have to learn new stuff. You will never feel like you know everything.</p> 
review185: You can easily get drawn into the Microsoft bubble with the only products and methods you know being in-house. Management decisions are top-down and can be in-transparent (not the place to feel self-empowered).</p> 
review186: Stack ranking makes team mates your competition and incites turf wars. Stack ranking can lead to a vicious cycle: Since stack ranking works like a highly stochastic merge sort, if you are a good contributor on a team with superb teammates working on a risky project that does not pan out, you will likely get a poor review, which happened to me after initial good reviews. Being the last rat to leave the sinking ship, I watched my teammates leave for other teams and companies. My poor rating made it impossible to leave my team and lead to continued poor ratings, so I eventually left under duress.</p> 
review187: Uncompetitive compensation (used to be good, not anymore) Relatively (very) slow promotion Difficult to make product impact (Extremely) non-transparent performance review (your boss controls everything)</p> 
review188: Older style of doing things - waterfall vs. agile</p> 
review189: The &#034;One Microsoft&#034; philosophy is only starting to get implemented, so there&#039;s quite a bit of &#034;reinventing the wheel&#034; still going on.</p> 
review190: re-orgs, career velocity, people manager quality</p> 
review190: Working OT (late nights, weekends) is basically required. Although not said verbally, it is expected and will be reflected in your reviews (connects). Additionally, reviews are very political. If you find yourself in a good group and get along with your manager then you are set (i.e. boys club), if not, then you will be slowly managed out. I personally saw this for a number of individuals.</p> 
review191: &#034;not created here&#034; culture. anti-social environment.</p> 
review192: Too top heavy. Everyone is a Senior something or other or a Principal. People are more worried about their competition and aiming for the next promotion than being focused on delivering the best work.</p> 
review193: I think that when you get into a large company, they start handing down lots of training initiatives that just don&#039;t work in a realistic setting. More training needs to come from people that are actually in the positions, not a training department sitting in Redmond.</p> 
review194: 1. Some MS products are in maintenance mode and if you are stuck in those teams there is not much to learn. 2. Management has lot of old guys with 20+ experience who are not adding much value to the company but are holding top posts. 3. Some products do not have clear future road map and they get shut down before reaching the customers.</p> 
review195: Political obstacles affect nearly every aspect of what you do at MS. You will land on one side of the fence when pitted against your own team wrt performance. Team work is limited by this fact. If you are on the right side of the performance fence it&#039;s a rewarding place to work, if not, you will be micro-managed and won&#039;t enjoy what you are doing there. Advice: Be willing to work hard and slightly less smart than you actually are so as to not get a poor review. Quality doesn&#039;t seem to matter as much as &#034;just getting it done&#034; does these days as the emphasis has changed recently. Contributions are evaluated based on results. Key to getting results is to publicize what achievements that you generated within and outside of your group. Pick your partners carefully as their failures will be evaluated as your own failures as well. Sub-responsibilities that cannot be evaluated easily or at all because your boss may not or can not understand the benefit. Spend as little time on those responsibilities as you can as there is no value to your performance review by spending time on sub-responsibilities you may have inherited or gained familiarity with along the way that are not directly related to your objectives for the current month.</p> 
review196: Management focused on keeping their jobs vs. taking risks</p> 
review197: Stack rankings. (Since eliminated)</p> 
review198: Fast pace and breadth of offerings can sometimes be distracting. You are expected to be entrepreneurial and provide solutions not just point out problems. If you just want a 9-5 job doing the same thing every day this company is not for you. Somewhat limited in relationship marketing funding.</p> 
review199: Environment is not for the faint of heart. Be prepared to work your butt off but also be prepared to be well compensated for doing a good job. Going the extra mile is expected.</p> 
review199: Very demanding in regards to retail training.</p> 
review200: intense workload little time for family</p> 
review201: nothing big that I can think of</p> 
review202: Hard to shift career paths, especially at higher levels Microsoft has never figured out career growth Quality of managers varies dramatically</p> 
review203: It&#039;s a big company. I worked remotely. It can be challenging to navigate on your own.</p> 
review204: The bureaucratics of the company get a little complicated. If you get mixed up in reorg it&#039;s frustrating.</p> 
review205: Long hours and difficult work/life balance are definite features of a career in MS&#039;s &#034;front office</p> 
review206: If you are part of an entity that was acquired by Microsoft, one needs to look hard into how your role align to the overall MSFT strategy, otherwise your will be sidelined.</p> 
review207: Sooooooo much bureaucracy. Feels like fighting through mud just to get anything done. Every decision has to go up 6 levels and come back down. Constant re-orgs and cancelled projects. Lots of infighting between different divisions. Only form of culture is a self-congratulatory sense that Microsoft is the best place ever (which it isn&#039;t) and it&#039;s employees are the smartest ever (which they aren&#039;t).</p> 
review208: Bureaucratic, too many people solving too small of a set of problems. Old management has the most influence on product vision.</p> 
review208: Sometimes it can be challenging dealing with someone that just don&#039;t understand our products!</p> 
review209: - if manager is not good, then sucks - some hierarchy and red tape in certain process</p> 
review210: Don&#039;t fool yourself, the stack ranking still exists. Found myself on a leadership team where we put knives in backs, daily. The culture of this place prohibits any semblance of innovation or creativity. Just look at their products. Are you buying them? I&#039;m not. This is a vicious place to work where self-preservation trumps teamwork. On our leadership team, we scrambled to keep up with our competition, and always found ourselves 5 steps behind. In a company that touts leadership, I found the &#034;leaders&#034; I worked with to be followers, merely mouthing the words of someone smarter, who said things months, if not years, before they did. As much as Microsoft embraces strategy, I found very little strategic vision within its walls. Microsoft is no longer a monopolistic utility telling its customers how much they are going to spend on their products. Better companies are finding ways to gain market share by doing guess what? Providing products and services that customers actually want. I think of Microsoft as the GM of the 80s. Still plenty of hubris, not quite smart enough to see that they already lost the race...</p> 
review211: At the end of the day, you&#039;re not going to be doing the most exciting or interesting work in this role, by design. They really just want code monkeys for 90% of the work.</p> 
review212: depending on the group you are in, sometimes things could be difficult. with recent shakeup, people are feeling nervous sometimes. gets too big.</p> 
review213: Hard to contribute to a project without experience in the group you are in. Some process or documentation could help. Also, a project larger than bug-fixes would be nice, but maybe I just need to wait for something interesting.</p> 
review214: Historically, Microsoft has relied on Office/Windows revenue to hit their revenue projections. The market has changed. There is increased competition that has impacted the sales teas ability to make quota.</p> 
review215: Management is on the same page with requirement</p> 
review216: Too large. Too political. Have to ask to get promoted, it does not happen on its own.</p> 
review217: Benefits are falling behind the competition Hard to move up in the company once you reach the senior band</p> 
review217: Muddled, unaccountable, big middle management. PFEs have an Account Manager as a person manager, and they work with TAMs and often other Project Managers, Architects, etc. in the course of their work. I notice that Account Managers are often not only maladroit with respect to Microsoft technology, but technology in general. And they often are really poor managers. Microsoft has a &#039;connect&#039; process that HR instituted to force managers and employees to talk several times a year. Often, Account Managers view this as a checkbox, and it&#039;s symptomatic if their not putting much effort into managing people. TAMs are supposed to be Technical Account Managers, but often they are neither technical nor managers. You can&#039;t have a grown-up conversation with TAMs, often, because they don&#039;t understand the technology. They are supposed to be bridge between the customer and the technical PFEs, but I have seen a lot of slacker TAMs who actually just make PFEs life more difficult. And I&#039;ve heard customers say that they want the good work that PFEs do, but they don&#039;t want to pay for the exorbitant associated costs of having to also pay for ADMs, TAMS, etc. etc. Career advancement within various fiefdoms is not based on technical merit or utilization or even how valuable you are to your customer, but based on &#039;go along to get along&#039; mentality and kissing up to management.</p> 
review218: Very competitive. While current CEO is trying to soften culture it will take time. Constant pressure and always increasing expectations should be expected.</p> 
review219: A little bureaucratic sometimes Middle management sucks</p> 
review220: Generic problems relating to a huge organization. You need to know your way around in order to get things done. Often far too many meetings happening, which effectively waste a lot of time.</p> 
review221: Lot of bureaucracy, slow pace changes, lack of standardized tools and processes. Lot of reinventing of wheel all over the company.</p> 
review222: Big Corp sometimes feels less than personal. Oftentimes have witnessed leadership take credit and get rewarded without acknowledging or recognizing those that get their organizations to where they are.</p> 
review223: As a big company, there are the red tape and politics that come with that sort of thing. No real professional manager training or support. People rise to be managers because they are good contributors, not because they are good people managers</p> 
review224: Base salary not as competitive as rates at other similar companies. Working overtime is not required but highly encouraged depending on the team. Advancement in position may take a long time when you get to certain levels. Senior managers frequently give the impression that they have no idea what they&#039;re doing.</p> 
review225: Don&#039;t let the commercials fool you. If you&#039;re in sales you better hit your number or you&#039;re out the door. Nepotism runs rampant. EPG and Services fight constantly. Each wants to hit their number and the customer be damned. At the VP levels and below, idiots run the show and as long as they&#039;re hitting their number, they keep their job. Doesn&#039;t matter if they run good people off or are leaving a lot of money on the table. They got rid of the old employee rating system and instituted a new one that is still the same. A rose by any other name, in other words. Neither were/are very good. Again, with nepotism, you better be part of the good ole boy network or you&#039;re potentially doomed.</p> 
review226: I worked in a unit that was only interested in certain genders moving up to management. While it makes stats work for the outside world, it is not a real motive for staff. Perhaps this has changed these days.</p> 
review226: If you land in a wrong group you might be mismanaged, as everywhere</p> 
review227: Some politics you have to deal with sometimes.</p> 
review228: Being in operations is not ideal, you work a lot with vendors that are not the smartest cookies out there. The role is very redundant.</p> 
review229: west coast is expensive housing is hard to find at a reasonable price corporate housing is a bit expensive</p> 
review230: Salary offered was less as per my expectations.</p> 
review231: Pretty bureaucratic, middle management is a bit of a mess and there&#039;s too many pockets for under performers to lurk for too long before being held accountable.</p> 
review232: But, if your manager is new and is pretty much only about a power game with other managers, you will find yourself lost and gone within a year. Reorgs. They are horrendous to people&#039;s psyches. Layoffs - they can ruin people&#039;s lives. Or, they can be a blessing in disguise. If you were an employee who worked remotely, they dumped you first even if you were a straight A, gave everything, high performer. Oh, and they laid off MANY people who were weeks or months away from their 15 year anniversary. They have no moral compass anymore and HR is in the toilet.</p> 
review233: stress, lack of work life balance, need some change, too big, need to learn new stuff</p> 
review234: It can be very hard to get information related to your current work because it is such a large organisation and information didn&#039;t flow unless asked for. Turn over on our teams was high so there was lots of legacy systems no one knew anything about but that were critical to the business.</p> 
review235: Politics abound and many decisions are made arbitrarily.</p> 
review235: Highly competitive, encourages lots of criticism of peers and managers. Not enough to just do a good job. You must do something to stand out above your peers at each stage, otherwise you will trend down and be pushed out.</p> 
review236: Only a few teams need to work with edge cutting tech which means out of company, your experience of value is limited.</p> 
review237: - limited career prospects outside of WA - frustrating</p> 
review238: politics, at times limited autonomy, lots of travel if not in Redmond WA</p> 
review239: More of a copy cat than a innovator. Middle management is pretty happy just keeping the status quo.</p> 
review240: constant reorganization, non stable internal organizational structures</p> 
review241: Culture rewards to those most adept at self promotion rather than producing tangible results. Company in flux.</p> 
review242: Tech lead and lacking in customer focus. Lots of silos and infighting</p> 
review243: I really can&#039;t think of anything negative to put. This has been a great fit for me personally and I wouldn&#039;t trade anything.</p> 
review244: Position is a mess between corporate and retail sides of Microsoft. Horrible work life balance. Micromanaging leadership.</p> 
review244: Small part of a large origanozation</p> 
review245: If you have a great manager you will have a great experience.</p> 
review246: Work/Life Balance can be challenging. Additionally, the nature of the technology business is one where most everyone is looking out for themselves so you have to have thick skin and understand that environment.</p> 
review247: Some big company bureaucracy and politics remain. Hardware refresh of 3+ years kind of archaic in the current rate of change.</p> 
review248: The company put new grads not in their best places, randomly to different groups, without considering the backgrounds.</p> 
review249: No team work. Cut throat competition within teams. PM&#039;s and Devs are more like enemies and competitors. They need too work together.</p> 
review250: Politics like in any big company, some groups rise above them but many don&#039;t. Often too many decision makers which slows things down and creates duplicate work.</p> 
review251: difficult upward mobility, annual review process is dated, too much red tape when you need to get a job done</p> 
review252: * Depending on the project, some extra work than regular hours might be required, but besides that nothing else to complain.</p> 
review253: They will let you go in a heart beat based on politics or reorg. Won&#039;t even let you apply for internal jobs. They are absolutely heartless when it comes to treating people right. I can&#039;t count the number of good, talented people who were let go for trivial reasons. I was there for over 12 years until it happened to me too.</p> 
review253: * Microsoft truly has some amazing products and technologies but we don&#039;t always do a good job of telling the story about our products. Our competitors often make a huge deal of features and functionalities that Microsoft products have had in years. Even as a FTE and 10+ years at the company (true blue Microsoftie), I often come across things in our products I didn&#039;t know existed. We can do better in that area. To give credit where due though, under the leadership of our (relatively) new EVP Marketing - Chris Capossella, there are truly impactful, meaningful and inspiring advertisements, and marketing strategies that reflect the power and potential of Microsoft products, better than how we have done in the past. * While Benefits are better than many other companies, it used to be better a few years ago. Medical was &#034;free&#034; and Microsoft took care of all the medical expenses. With the changes a few years ago, preventive care is &#039;free&#039; but employees have a co-pay for all other medical expenses. * Compared to similar tech companies like Facebook and Google, we don&#039;t have &#034;Free Food&#034; although &#034;Free Soda/Juices&#034; are available in every building. * Sometimes things may not seem very transparent across management layers and working across teams may sometimes seem complicated. But with the newer One Microsoft philosophy and way of working under Satya&#039;s leadership, there is way less politics and way more collaboration, and partnership. * Moving across organizations is relatively challenging (eg. moving from IT to Engineering/Product Group); also cross-org movement after a certain level (Level 65) is challenging. If you want to experience different orgs, move while still a L63 or 64. * Likewise L65 and above is a shark-tank.</p> 
review254: I wish there were more opportunities for growth within this position. Although there is a plethora of marketing positions at Microsoft, there is a perceived disadvantage of being a retail employee, despite similar skills, education, background, and qualifications.</p> 
review255: Gotta play to get paid. Self-promotion is a constant necessity along with the ear of your skip-manager (your actual manager has no power to grant you rewards). Annual &#034;Connect&#034;s are only as good as your skip&#039;s willingness to read feedback. Glowing reviews can be sent straight to the Recycle Bin because it was &#034;too time consuming&#034; to read them all. Dogmatic adherence to the Microsoft ecosystem. Wanna write something in Python? Forget it. Switch teams (and company while your at it). Have a great OSS resource you&#039;d like to pull into a project? Good luck getting through LCA approval. Butthurt is all around when someone calls a MS baby ugly.</p> 
review256: The way to get ahead is to snap into the matrixed organization. Those that get to the top are not liked by all, just by the few that need to be impressed.</p> 
review257: A lot of change is happening, it is not always well thought through or executed. This can result in lack of clarity in role and expectations.</p> 
review258: Work/life balance can be challenging.</p> 
review259: Very repetitive work, wanted to bash my head against the wall at times out of boredom.</p> 
review260: Don&#039;t like the latest performance review system</p> 
review261: No free time whatsoever, no diversity within its walls as expected but makes very isolated for someone who is outside of the standard.</p> 
review262: Bad review system. Lot of negativity and back stabbing.</p> 
review262: Bad review system. Lot of negativity and back stabbing.</p> 
review263: Work-life balance can be challenging</p> 
review264: The company is really large. When I left Microsoft, there were 11 managers in-between me and the CEO, and I had gone through 2 reorgs.</p> 
review265: Too political these days, management is great but needs to improve the intellectual culture from the top down.</p> 
review266: Employees very focused on individual targets, which are aggressive Metrics drive behaviors not always conducive to healthy team environment Work-life integration is an issue</p> 
review267: Absolutely no cons. I think Microsoft is a great company. I am a Software Engineer and love it. I interviewed at other places and none of them even compared to Microsoft.</p> 
review268: Too big, process heavy and not as agile, depends a lot on the team you are in.</p> 
review269: Nothing as such to be called con</p> 
review270: annoying customers that can&#039;t help but to compare you with Apple and declare which is better. Not a lot of full time opportunities.</p> 
review271: Networking is key to be successful in the company. You have to reach out proactively and continuously by yourself to expand your own networks both inside and outside the company. The culture is not for everyone, but for people who fit in, it could be a great place to work.</p> 
review271: - Quite large ==&gt; easy to get lost in the fray - Review process (&lt;2011) - Strategic vision - Culture (can be unpleasant, &lt;2011) - ask someone there now - HR weak; poor workforce planning; limited opportunities for advancement - Horrible mix, FTE&#039;s : contractors - way too much reliance upon contractors - quality, recent products (Windows 10, for example)</p> 
review272: Co-workers aren&#039;t always team players, but Microsoft is broadly known for that anyway so I&#039;m not adding anything new.</p> 
review273: Like some other big companies, there are individuals that are not making a big impact, but still receive big rewards.</p> 
review274: * Legacy of bad code, bad technology * Unclear goals (subject to the team) * Poor communications, too many unrelated corporate spam * Tend to use in-house products many of them are far below open market competitors</p> 
review275: No room for growth. Very political.</p> 
review276: -You really must ask for help to get it -I had one bad management experience -Trying to do more with less employees- seem to be following recruiting industry trend</p> 
review277: work politics in some branches, too much meetings,</p> 
review278: - last bit of bureaucracy remains</p> 
review279: The pay does not competitive</p> 
review280: Work life balance will not be as good as you would like. The salary compared to other big tech companies is not as good.</p> 
review280: Company that is complex and political</p> 
review281: There will be always some politics at upper levels.</p> 
review282: Lots of management and unnecessary initiatives</p> 
review283: They look for career secretaries/ administrative assistants, so it&#039;s not that great if you are looking to advance beyond that type of role. Limited advancement opportunities if you are not located in Redmond, WA. No equity or bonus structure for administrative support staff. Way to many disparate internal systems and processes that are time consuming and redundant.</p> 
review284: Hey, No complaints right now.</p> 
review285: Too many top layer management that can&#039;t effectively manage. Also too many old-school folks that&#039;s been recycled at Microsoft and been there for over 10 years with antiquated ideas of running a business model that isn&#039;t innovative. Unfortunately these &#039;old-school&#039; folks are great at the politics game and can jump from 1 group to the next once they&#039;ve been found ineffective.</p> 
review286: Despite the traditional product and feature silos coming down across the organization, leading to streamlined workflows, this is still a 100,000+ person company at the end of the day. Management often talks about making changes that have been strongly desired by our customers, just to ultimately turn their back on the change. This directly contradicts the &#039;Customer Obsession&#039; that is so widely talked about at Microsoft, and points to a far more profound revenue obsession. There is cool stuff happening, but that does not come close to outweighing the lingering problems that customers beg us to address, that management refuses to act on.</p> 
review287: Some teams have sub cultures which are detrimental to work-life balance. It can be hard to stand out as the standard is so high.</p> 
review288: 1) can be stressful unless you are competent</p> 
review289: Long hours, very competitive, it doesn&#039;t matter if you went to Harvard if you don&#039;t exceed expectations you are gone, everyone is crazy smart</p> 
review289: Communication with candidate is not good. HR wouldn&#039;t get back to me on most questions, even if they did, it took weeks.</p> 
review290: Retail. Do not expect a promotion as there are only a few stores in the state</p> 
review291: Too many disparate processes and tools.</p> 
review292: job is mostly boring, you get to do what you don&#039;t like sometimes.</p> 
review293: Middle management could not seem to let go of the past... the company is moving towards a platform agnostic setup that focuses on services, yet many managers I talked with still help to the concept that &#034;Windows is king&#034;. Work/Life Balance was not a phrase what was known. I was expected to reply to emails at 1am and 5am... You can forget your vacation because you would have to have your email on you 24/7. This was the reason I left</p> 
review294: Microsoft is a very competitive environment that promotes non-synergistic behavior between peers. This prevents teams from finding their full potential of working together and at time rewards self-serving behavior.</p> 
review295: Many a times adds features to products, that are technologically great, but may not get customer adoption quickly. So it may be hard sometimes to see the impact of your work, if you are working on such a feature.</p> 
review296: Significant Internal Politics Style over substance Slow moving Too Many Teams competing for same bonuses Corp Executives Rarely see eye to eye</p> 
review297: Lot of Politics, Skills are undervalued at times than your ability to maneuver in political environment.</p> 
review298: Was hard to adjust at first</p> 
review298: bad review culture still there, still need you to show impact rather than work on your job</p> 
review299: No work/life balance. Goal of management is to push you to your breaking point and keep you there. Terrible place to work if you have a family.</p> 
review300: Company moves slow, too much time spent on internal politics</p> 
review301: politics, getting busier and busier, grow too slow</p> 
review302: Work to life balance is not so great.</p> 
review303: I love this company, always have and always will. We&#039;re moving in the right direction but we need to stop dropping the ball on certain things. I.e. companies beating us to the punch. Microsoft can be a great company depending on who your manager is. Some are great some are a completely failure. In that case get your foot in the door and shift elsewhere or hope for the best; the manager will move elsewhere.</p> 
review304: Management communication can sometimes be absent or not particularly transparent Mid-manager-level HR overhead can be daunting Some leadership/roadmap paralysis in non-core businesses A few truly unpleasant folks (like everywhere) Career/technical development is strictly up to the individual (maybe as it should be)</p> 
review305: We never released the product; too much corporate back and forth</p> 
review306: - Bureaucracy: the company still feels big, old, and heavy. Everything needs a million approvals, and people get back to you slowly. - Are we going to make it? The company is way behind in many markets and may not come back. There is enough cash in the bank to last forever, but there will be a point of no return well before the money runs out. - Some products *suck*, and you&#039;re expected to use them anyway. It&#039;s also really embarrassing and demoralizing to make crappy products. - &#034;Kool aid&#034;: many people internally seem to think our products are much better than they are. There is a vocal feedback culture telling them the products suck, but some teams aren&#039;t listening. This can be extremely frustrating. - Management is inconsistent. Many divisions and individual managers are excellent, but there are also giant pockets of rottenness, ranging from HR-type problems to poor feedback to over-focusing on short-term results to simple poor decision making. If you&#039;re coming to work here, make sure your manager is solid. Of the orgs I&#039;m familiar with, I would recommend the C+E organization (Azure) and disrecommend Microsoft IT (highly political). - Slow to promote/give raises, causing many good employees to bounce to competitors for a while, then back, in order to get their fair market wage. - There are a bunch of old-timers who still don&#039;t get it and act like it&#039;s 2002 and we own the world. They aren&#039;t doing well and are slowly getting pushed out, but they&#039;re still around annoying the rest of us.</p> 
review307: bad management evil people who dont like you</p> 
review307: The culture varies widely across company functions, groups and locations. Get in a great group, and you have a great experience. The bad groups are a nightmare. And it&#039;s very difficult to move from a terrible group to a good one. Long-time employees know about the gap, so when they find a great leader/manager, they stick with him/her. Meanwhile turnover is high in bad groups -- lots of opportunities. But there are rarely jobs available in the good groups. So if you&#039;re offered a job, do A LOT of research on the group and the people you&#039;ll be working with.</p> 
review308: No real cons to speak of besides the benefits that were once great are now just good. Other than that no other real cons</p> 
review309: Toxic environment, bad for women, stack ranking is alive and well</p> 
review310: Difficult to transition to other opportunities within the company without having established relationships</p> 
review311: lots of politics, software concentric</p> 
review312: Unclear formula for review, tough to reach and meet the expectation. Totally your review result is your direct manager dependent.</p> 
review313: Managers really make the job worth it or not Messed up metric systems by which support employees are held to - taking your vacation counts against your metric. Getting sick counts against your metric. Disability team and hr do not actually help do anything. Older, male centric environment. Being different led to being isolated. Constantly.</p> 
review314: Company culture is still working its way to a truly collaborative environment and away from the dreaded innovation killing silos. The influence of the legacy extreme performance review structure is still leading to effective employees being forced out (granted it&#039;ll always be hard to separate all the wheat from the chaff).</p> 
review315: It&#039;s really difficult to change culture or innovate processes. While they have been revamping their entire engineering process lately, there&#039;s still a lot of work to do.</p> 
review316: Very difficult to get in. The corporate ladder is existent, but some may not mind it because of the culture and people at Microsoft.</p> 
review316: Can be hard to get visibility in some orgs, layoffs can be very unsettling especially on a work visa</p> 
review317: old school management in some areas are holding them back</p> 
review318: Some teams seem to be in maintenance mode, I would avoid those teams. Not clear if Windows phone will survive.</p> 
review319: Not many unless you have a manager whom you dont gel with. I understand the draconian rating system has been eliminated.</p> 
review320: No compassion for people Not much opportunity to move internally No longer interested in developing and educating internal personnel</p> 
review321: Management bad Review process bad CEO bad HR biased Products bad</p> 
review322: Too big to add value as an only dev.</p> 
review323: Large company with many layers of management Very Political as you advance up management</p> 
review324: somewhat large and disorganized. Lots of people who don&#039;t contribute but there for pay check and hire a ton of vendors.</p> 
review325: Politics does play a role in performance sometimes. If you aren&#039;t on a big project when most of the rest of your team is, you have the chance of ranking lower than them. Ranking does still occur. It has to. Microsoft still &#034;culls&#034; a percentage of their poorest performers and the definition of &#034;poor performer&#034; can be directly impacted by the performance of your manager.</p> 
review325: Too much Redmond Centric. Growth for remote employees is limited. Leadership is somewhat stupid and comes from a legacy background. Very little fresh blood.</p> 
review326: Environment can be competitive at times. Some times the pace of work can be frustrating as there are so many people and many lines of management.</p> 
review327: So big, bad for remote workers if not in sales</p> 
review328: Ad hoc engineering process, relies on brute force to delivery; poor mid level management</p> 
review329: * Pay wasn&#039;t the best in the industry until couple years ago. Now its slowly coming to par with likes of google, FB, etc. While the amazing benefits compensate for some of that, its still better to get more hard cash in hand, * Little bit of bureaucracy. Fading away as Satya has taken over. * Not much of stock benefits</p> 
review330: if somebody has survived there long enough to make it into middle management, it means they cut their teeth back in (and had what it took to succeed through the grinder of) the &#034;bad old days&#034; -- (all time up to a several few years ago) when the behaviors that were cultivated and rewarded are not the kind of place I want to work in in 2015.</p> 
review331: Nothing bad to say, really</p> 
review332: I can&#039;t think of any cons at present</p> 
review333: Career management has gone down the drain. Increasing work demands over the years - travel has creeped into the job description where it was not there previously</p> 
review334: Not many cons to report. Perhaps the review system and the competitive culture but that&#039;s typical of a high tech company.</p> 
review334: Some groups don&#039;t have good leadership so get to know which team you are going to be working for and talk to a few people within that group before picking one. Review system is still a bit broken as it involves you being compared against peers and not exactly the outcomes. There are some positive improvements though, I think it will get better with time.</p> 
review335: Hard to feel like you&#039;re making a real impact, beauracracy</p> 
review336: Hard to pretend that my work is meaningful</p> 
review337: - Too much politics at middle management. - Sometimes slow paced. - Not exposed to outside MSFT technologies</p> 
review338: organization too decentralized. Roles replicated in my teams</p> 
review339: Lot of stress. Even the performance review system changed, the mindset of the managers never change. They always compare with the same level peers even if the peer has been doing development work since for ever and the other person has just come from SDET to development.</p> 
review340: No specific structure for advancement.</p> 
review341: Big company and can move slowly.</p> 
review342: Huge company. Some managers are better than others. Sink or swim mentality. HR is in control (not as entrepreneurial as it used to be).</p> 
review343: - Hard to find a proper mentor within such a large company - Can be hard to connect on a deeper level with others because there are so many people</p> 
review343: Not many cons to report. Perhaps the review system and the competitive culture but that&#039;s typical of a high tech company.</p> 
review344: Employee level system makes internal job growth extremely challenging.</p> 
review345: Many employees are worked to death. 60-70 hour weeks are not uncommon, and almost everyone I know is on their phone checking mail in the evening, on weekends, even on vacation. Depending on the division you work in, silos are unavoidable and maddening. Can be tough to get anything done in a truly &#034;One Microsoft&#034; sense unless you are very skilled at navigating the matrix, which can take years to perfect.</p> 
review346: A massive giant. Things more slow here (although it has begin to change lately). To get something done, a lot of infrastructure/process hurdles needs to be crossed.</p> 
review347: Might not find what you really want to pursue as a career</p> 
review348: some managers have the title but truly aren&#039;t good managers. Not people person. they might have let their title get to their heads.</p> 
review349: Some groups have too much politics and people tend to territorial. But that is improving under new leadership.</p> 
review350: Retail is retail so the cons are all typical retail related cons. Long hours, working on holidays and weekends, cranky customers, etc.</p> 
review351: Nobody is willing to go out of their way to assist you with personal projects. Time-consuming and unintuitive tasks given occasionally.</p> 
review352: The environment can be stressful and management is uneven. With a good manager you can have a wonderful experience, but there are frequent reorgs and overnight your great job can turn into a nightmare if you end up with a bad manager.</p> 
review352: Same as other big companies. Slow in changing</p> 
review353: Not all managers are good around here</p> 
review354: Too many conflicting priorities. Many manages, especially in Licensing, do not understand Cloud and are just &#039;resting and vesting&#039; in their roles.</p> 
review355: A lot of bureaucracy and administrative overhead and too many processes and procedures that changed frequently and often get in the way of doing &#034;real work&#034;.</p> 
review356: Infighting is still a very real problem at MS. There has been a major push to remove the once toxic competition between orgs over the last few years, but it&#039;s still gaining traction. Re-orgs, leadership turnover, and office moves are frequent.</p> 
review357: Red Tape, can get lost in the shuffle</p> 
review358: Legacy management still in place. Yes, SteveB is gone and some of the new kids (Satya, ScottGu) now have substantial scope, but middle to senior management is still littered with lifers who are slow to adapt.</p> 
review359: Development process is overall slow. Does not respond to trend quick.</p> 
review360: Still some pockets of the old guard mentality in working in Silo&#039;s. Still lots of waste in overhead and spending on the wrong stuff. Review model is still a black hole and comp is overall less than before</p> 
review361: work politics are unavoidable, constant re-orgs</p> 
review361: Constantly on your feet.. That is about it</p> 
review362: Misalignment of incentives, slow decision-making process</p> 
review363: There are teams that are still hanging on to the old ways of software development and not fully taking bets on other teams&#039; technologies.</p> 
review364: Too many re-orgs. Makes it feel unstable</p> 
review365: Its too large, to much double speak, and more often than not the right hand is not talking to the left.</p> 
review366: the company culture is to not be first in innovating but rather play catch up. they pitch otherwise but in a close room the right people admit to be the case. there&#039;s desire to change that but culture is the last thing that you can turn around from one day to the other. people organize plans and goals around what is more amicable to their next review outlook, particularly general management. Reinventing a language just because you can mark it off two years later is not delivering innovation. That hurts the company outlook.</p> 
review367: Slow-moving, lots of red tape, don&#039;t code as much</p> 
review368: - Awkward performance appraisal - Easy to get lost in Crowd, as multiple doing the same thing</p> 
review369: A lot of bureaucracy and administrative overhead and too many processes and procedures that changed frequently and often get in the way of doing &#034;real work&#034;.</p> 
review370: high deductible savings account with low match</p> 
review370: Decisions are made by people that have never worked in the field.</p> 
review371: Sometimes too bureaucratic, work/life balance can be tough</p> 
review372: * Reducing number of employees on a regular basis to cut costs * Who you know is critical for advancement/employment * Rate of self-learning is below competitors * Easy to coast if you can find the right team/manager</p> 
review373: Good ole boy network, review process drives strong people out</p> 
review374: Too many levels of management sometimes.</p> 
review375: difficult internal mobility in HR, a lot of politics in stack ranking which makes it difficult to ensure top compensation year over year</p> 
review376: Mid level management is very weak. Lack of vision and decision making skills.</p> 
review377: Seems to target older employees that can bring wisdom to a situation as obstructionist rather than bringing a sense of reality to a situation. Expectation to work all hours of the day and night, but tout supporting work/life balance. Once someone tries to have work/life balance, they are marked as slacking off. Glad to be gone from there. Also, the rating system is rigged for favorites rather than what was produced, which makes moving to another group almost impossible if you are not one of the favorites.</p> 
review378: Large and slow - a lot of middle management paper pushers who are where they are just because they have spent time in MS</p> 
review379: Intense and hard driving. You have to be very disciplined to keep a work/life balance.</p> 
review379: The workload can be intense and demanding. Schedules are often extremely tight. It can often be difficult to learn all that you want to about a new technology or project, because there is only time to focus on the current critical issue.</p> 
review380: big and still lots of bad execs (CVP, VPs)</p> 
review381: Toxic environment, people don&#039;t trust/help each other Fear culture Mismanagement, bad leadership</p> 
review382: bureaucracy in process and communication leads to huge lags in time for decision making and lots of whiplash across the organization in preparing materials</p> 
review383: Hostile inter-group relations. A lot of finger-pointing to find fault. Loss of continuity on support and maintenance of core shared libraries and technologies when those technologies are considered &#034;outdated&#034; and &#034;no longer sexy&#034;.</p> 
review384: Although PMs are really important and contribute a ton to our product, sometimes I feel like there are too many.</p> 
review385: - NO FREE FOOD! it sucks... - You won&#039;t get the latest Mac Book Pro and iPhone when join - To get promoted you often should be a fried of your manager - Comparatively low compensation - Might get some routine boring tasks if you are not in the right team, though you can switch them pretty easily</p> 
review386: All type A personalities - they preach teamwork, but then reward only a few people that take credit for all that team work.</p> 
review387: Too much churn, tough work life balance</p> 
review388: It can be more adventurous</p> 
review388: I ultimately left the company for multiple reasons, and they all had to do with poor management. I had 5 managers in 2 years. The job I was hired for was reorg&#039;d away between the time I was hired and my first day of work. The job I was given when I arrived lasted 6 months before my team was reorg&#039;d and moved under a different manager doing completely different work. That job was reorg&#039;d away another 6 months later. Most managers did little help their people improve, often didn&#039;t do anything to leverage people&#039;s strengths, and were many times afraid to be forthright about performance. Although the rating system changed in the past year and a half, the results aren&#039;t much different. People still get stack ranked, and those on the bottom are put in a position where moving within Microsoft is next to impossible (requires VP sign-off from both the losing and gaining org), so their only option is to leave. I saw several good people leave the company as a result.</p> 
review389: Very unfair when it comes to review. I have worked with managers who would sale one direct reports work on another another senior direct report. Managers change review if you are moving to another team.</p> 
review390: Sinking and bloated subcontinent of the IT world. Race to bottom by endless layoff rounds.</p> 
review391: I wish i could say the rumored infighting at Microsoft between groups and teams was not existent but that would be false. However with all the major re-orging that has taken place the infighting has certainly reduced but still there. Microsoft is an older tech company and it shows. a lot of things are still very politically driven and there are still very strong hierarchical barriers. Ideas still mostly come from the top down. All this is changing but slowly.</p> 
review392: None that I can think.</p> 
review393: long hours, but still Pros outweigh the cons</p> 
review394: Totally depending on teams, but in some team, not everybody are interested in personal development. You may find low quality work sometime.</p> 
review395: Moving up can be hard useless you can move around a lot.</p> 
review396: Development cycles can be slow, but making good progress to speed up with new CEO.</p> 
review397: Because the group is so big, it&#039;s hard for upper management to consider all employee&#039;s work balances.</p> 
review397: Can get swallowed up in Microsoft world - see things through Microsoft lenses There is an expert for everything - so you will stay relatively confined to your pigeon hole</p> 
review398: It can be very competitive.</p> 
review399: Lots of transition to the cloud and shrinking margins. Management is lowing historical compensation rates. Terrible sales culture. Unable to set quotas effectively.</p> 
review400: grow slower than the beginning</p> 
review401: No development of contract employees. My office was a storage closet for 6 months. While I worked on some very complex routing protocols.</p> 
review402: Organization in the hardware teams is nonexistent and has pretty bad leadership all the way up the chain of command. Lots of layoffs since joining (over 7,000 people from the Nokia acquisition, hundreds of others from Xbox, Surface Hub, etc.). People don&#039;t seem driven and put in minimal effort/hours. Many are just cruising with their high-pay, low-stress jobs and focusing their time on things outside of work. Have to use Microsoft technologies to get all your work done (Outlook/Sharepoint/OneDrive), none of which work well because they push the internal buggy versions to everyone&#039;s machines. No real &#034;company culture&#034; that I can identify with. The company is focused way more on software and the hardware engineering operations are kind of a joke. Personally: project was canceled within three months of taking the job. The job I negotiated for was also not what I was placed into and management didn&#039;t seem to care. Ended up being a big step down on a technical level. There&#039;s an overall lack of any real challenge and, for most of my time here, a lack of any real work to do at all. Team was not prepared for my arrival -- couldn&#039;t log into computers, couldn&#039;t access emails, had no badge/couldn&#039;t access the building for four weeks and had to call coworkers to let me in after using the bathroom. Horrible experience from end to end.</p> 
review403: I am specialized in consumer services. Microsoft is putting all its focus to enterprise business. If you interested in cloud, I recommend you. Otherwise, there are better opportunities out there.</p> 
review404: The city is not mush change than SF</p> 
review405: The company is getting better at navigating its future, but it&#039;s still a bit lost. You can see attempts are underway to change course, but it&#039;s still a bit slow, especially since the company is very reliant on a lot of old software and ways of doing things to pay the bills.</p> 
review406: - Too technology focused and not about selling business value with customer - Sales management is junior varsity - Field sales is inwardly focused vs. focus on customer - Co-workers are about looking good to peers and sales management vs. focusing on customer sales pursuits - Quotas need to be reset around the reality of Offcie 365 and Azure and not about on-premises windows and office</p> 
review406: As with every company, there are some bad seeds. The bad seeds I have run into here are the worst I have ever seen in my life.</p> 
review407: Like any large company, the politics increase as you level up.</p> 
review408: stressful, must be able to maneuver the company intranet and figure out where to go and how to do it by yourself</p> 
review409: I like it, no cons for me</p> 
review410: Doesn&#039;t always have structured ramp-ups. There are too many teams work in silos that don&#039;t have good cross-team collaboration. Agile development can also mean dissemination of new products and features is not well communicated cross-team.</p> 
review411: microsoft decided to cut the lead role last year and turned all leads back to ICs. what used to happen normally in a 20-30 people team was that there are 3-4 leads for several well-defined and non-overlapping areas with 3-5 people underneath each, and maybe a few principal ICs reporting to the dev manager since they are too senior to report to the leads. upper management decided to cut the lead layer for whatever reason. now as far as I can tell there is no single person that&#039;s happier. 1. (ex-)leads: obvious. they got demoted. no paycut but hey, who likes being demoted? lots of people left immediately, many ex-leads are still leaving. 2. ICs: little/no sense of focus or attachment for junior ICs. out of collage newhires are simply lost. since leads only had small teams they used to have quite a lot of time for the new guys. now your manager has 20+ reports and runs from one meeting to another. and honestly there is little/no seniorIC-to-juniorIC mentorship unless you happen to go to a team with good people. there is nothing at microsoft that rewards mentoring juniors. 3. managers: they used to have 3-4 leads and plus a few principal ICs reporting to them. now 20+ direct reports. no time to do 1-on-1&#039;s and every single thing from the most important to the least escalates to you. 4. lack of management track: lead position was a stepping stone for becoming a manager later on. now it&#039;s gone and there is no track for ICs that want to see themselves managing a team in X years. if you&#039;re at microsoft ask this to your manager: &#034;what should I do today if I want to become a manager in X years&#034;. They won&#039;t have any answer. because there is none. No management track whatsoever. the chances you&#039;ll be managing a team is equal to somebody in the management chain leaving. and even if you would call that a management track (I wouldn&#039;t) that&#039;s the worst management track imaginable. think about it. One day you&#039;re an IC. next day you have 20+ people reporting to you.</p> 
review412: Review system is broken.</p> 
review413: In the competitive environment, you may tend to feel a bit intimidated by the performance of your co-workers</p> 
review414: Legacy slows things down Politics can come in the way and be very distracting</p> 
review415: Navigating organizational complexity. Decision making requires organizational agility to navigate.</p> 
review415: It is a large company that is changing. The management chain is very thick and there is an opportunity for bureaucracy at every corner - the smart people are able to work their way around it.</p> 
review416: It really depends on the group you work in. Some divisions, like the product groups, have a much healthier environment. They have more money and better laid out business plans. Other divisions like the support groups, you are at the whim of the product and business groups so there is less budget, less respect, and you sort of feel like you&#039;re on the bottom of the totem pole.</p> 
review417: cost of living, traffic, corp culture radically different among groups</p> 
review418: Typical corporate environment that no one should be surprised.</p> 
review419: Each contract stint has a pre-set time limit per company policy. Contract workers have to be away 6 months before thy can return.</p> 
review420: long working hours even weekends</p> 
review421: products are not very exciting.</p> 
review422: Could provide formal hands on training sessions on some of the technologies.</p> 
review423: Bogged down in ineffective middle management Performance review process changed yearly Men seem to move up more quickly than women</p> 
review424: Culture is cut throat, stack ranking performance rating system creates culture of paranoia. Employees are too afraid to take risks. Really hard to get anything substantial done, maintain and execute are the norm.</p> 
review424: Keeps making the same management and organizational mistakes over and over. Women are promoted slower, valued less. It matters more who you know than what impact you have had.</p> 
review425: Review process is broken. People are still treated and reviewed as singular data points as if people could be measured as if they were robots, cut off from collaboration and contribution with everyone else. Although they say that they do not, they only measure that &#039;impact&#039; that you as an individual made and not what the team as a whole did. This causes the individual to only look out for themselves and this is not the path to innovation and growth.</p> 
review426: Work life balance still leaves a lot to be desired. Very competitive culture... however it IS getting better...</p> 
review427: Former review system was designed to pit co-workers against each other. I&#039;ve read that this has changed recently and am hopeful that is the case. Management as-a-profession was overlooked. Most managers were risen from the ranks of specialists and while many were excellent some were absolutely not good in a manager role, this was not often acknowledged.</p> 
review428: Lots of internal competition for the best projects Managers are hit or miss Poor work/life balance</p> 
review429: Nothing, None, Nil, Zero, Empty</p> 
review430: sometimes have to deal with politics and other people&#039;s personalities, less work life balance, have to work hard, no test team to catch quality bugs so now everything is dev&#039;s responsibility.</p> 
review431: Red tape, too many layers</p> 
review432: MSFT is still going through changes with the new CEO which are slow.</p> 
review433: Nothing this place is great</p> 
review433: Culture is cut throat, stack ranking performance rating system creates culture of paranoia. Employees are too afraid to take risks. Really hard to get anything substantial done, maintain and execute are the norm.</p> 
review434: Limited Career growth No Long Term Job Longevity</p> 
review435: Constant organizational changes. Don&#039;t expect to keep the same manager for more than 2 years at a time. Moving between jobs internally has been made much easier than before, but it&#039;s still a challenge.</p> 
review436: market is too small, competitive is not strong</p> 
review437: At Director level - Pure and nasty politics. Despite of being one of the top Tech companies reports are made manually. Stone age. Very poor leadership skills. If you think that someone cares about to - forget it - Make the number and the next year they will double your quote - end result you are not going to get a bonus. If you are a women or men of principles and ethical values that is a wrong place to be. Work life balance completely negative.</p> 
review438: I was a contractor, which meant that I had far less job security and a rather sad excuse for benefits. No vacation pay, no sick pay, and the health benefits were a joke. I may have had a better impression of the overall experience if I hadn&#039;t been quite unceremoniously booted out the door with no two weeks of notice. Normally Microsoft has a general policy for contractors to work a certain amount of time before needing to take a 6 month hiatus before being allowed to return to the company. The contractors on this project however became assimilated into a greater part of the studio through some unclear and confusing policy which, we were told, meant an indefinite employment for &#034;at least 3 years&#034; and plenty of job opportunities to advance their career and even become FTE with Microsoft. Instead this turned out to be a bunch of bloated nonsense and after realizing that their budget was overblown, several people were quickly let go with no prior warnings.</p> 
review439: Killer hours and ridiculous timelines</p> 
review440: Mentor is busy sometimes and workload is not so heavy for an intern</p> 
review441: I really don&#039;t have anything bad to say.</p> 
review442: Length of process/approvals are too long many times.</p> 
review442: Inter-team and division politics can be a bit rough, but I hear this is getting better. All of the pitfalls that come with working at a mega-corporation.</p> 
review443: There was no free food! Quite a change, working at Redmond and paying for food at the cafe, as I had come from the Silicon Valley.</p> 
review444: Your experience will vary year to year: frequent reorgs means that you can be working on something completely different that you didn&#039;t choose and place you under new leads, and some of them aren&#039;t any good helping you progress or keep you interested in the job.</p> 
review445: After sometimes, you can get bored by doing the same thing. It&#039;s hard to climb up. If you have right manager sometimes its easy to get up, otherwise tricky.</p> 
review446: Lot of politics and no transparency from even from immediate managers. No choice in selecting work that you want to do. Can get stuck in a bad team and suffer for a long time. More emphasis on completion of the task than quality. Meeting deadline is more important, no matter how many regressions you introduce.</p> 
review447: - Lots of passive-aggressive people - Trust and team collaboration very low - Alignment among teams is a big challenge - Still too many people doing too many disjointed and duplicitive things</p> 
review448: Budgeting processes, too many meetings, requires an army to get anything done, slow and lack of agility</p> 
review449: Lack of agility. I don&#039;t see a good outlook given the decline of Windows market share and the lack of any mobile presence among competitors.</p> 
review450: Too many management levels makes it hard to rise up</p> 
review451: management should be more transparent sometimes.</p> 
review451: I like my team and manager, but I have heard stories from other teams of micromanaging, expectations of putting long hours and slave driving</p> 
review452: Microsoft has been developing a very political environment and the previously called stack ranking process (which was only rebranded for PR purposes), together with the &#034;good attrition&#034; target that every manager has (they are forced to let 5% of the people go each year), have contributed to the toxic and non-collaborative atmosphere in the company. After lay-offs and good attrition became standard operating procedure to make adjustments for any internal or external deviation, there are many &#034;clubs&#034; where groups of a certain affinity protect each other and play with the fire and hire tactics to keep each core intact, trading internal positions to give the impression of career movement, just to mention a few of the unfortunate aspects of the company&#039;s culture (or lack of). Microsoft became a company of middle managers that are very savvy on the political play, on making arrangements for survival with little to no space for taking risks, creativity or even have opinion.</p> 
review453: - Disjointed organizational structure. - Technical problem solvers often promoted to management roles where technical skills gradually become less useful, yet they are not vetted for or provided proper transition to management training.</p> 
review454: There&#039;s a lot of Red Tape. Big Corporate Feeling.</p> 
review455: Work Life balance. Nothing else.</p> 
review456: Huge bureaucracy with little ability to affect real change.</p> 
review457: Work demands place some strain on life/work balance.</p> 
review458: Lack of agility. I don&#039;t see a good outlook given the decline of Windows market share and the lack of any mobile presence among competitors.</p> 
review459: The new order of things ensures every two months another large round of layoffs occur. What used to be great collaboration is now employees hiding in their offices or cubes, afraid to open their mouths for fear of being on the next round of layoffs. Instead of collaboration to create something great, the new plan of survival is to silently watch the bus drive off the cliff.</p> 
review460: Upper management had no idea how we did our jobs, so they would change strategies at the drop of a hat, with no idea how they could be implemented from a practical standpoint.</p> 
review460: no work and life balance. Steressful</p> 
review461: Upper management had no idea how we did our jobs, so they would change strategies at the drop of a hat, with no idea how they could be implemented from a practical standpoint.</p> 
review462: Everything takes time to implement</p> 
review463: Too much management, a fair amount of politics</p> 
review464: Work/life balance sucks, lower management is extremely poor and lacking people skills, benefits are not as good as they were a decade ago, layoffs abound and there are less people to do the same amount of work, less opportunities for growth than there used to be, performance model is ridiculous..</p> 
review465: Some product teams feel like you are operating a ponzie scheme and the execs leading teams building DEV tools outside of the visual studio team and vs online really do not get the end customer.</p> 
review466: Leadership is weak in many areas of the Sales, Marketing and Services... esp. HR Leadership. Decision-making in HR is lousy and you spend so much time, energy and attention covering your rear-end that it just sucks the life out of you. Its become a miserable place to work. Lastly, the HR team is constantly laying off employees... it sucks.</p> 
review467: won&#039;t be a millionaire in three years</p> 
review468: Politics and Optics are more important than Results</p> 
review469: Sometimes slow to change, but getting better. As with any big company there is some politics. Not always sure why some people get promoted and others don&#039;t</p> 
review469: Not sure the overall organization is ready to embrace the Cloud</p> 
review470: bureaucracy, red tape, old mindset</p> 
review471: - Varied pace of working among different teams. - Lot of re orgs and change in management, which can slow down work and often lead to a change in direction.</p> 
review472: Team culture changes from team to team. Some teams are better than others, and it&#039;s important to find the good ones.</p> 
review473: Microsoft has become a little more top-down directed as of late and is experiencing growing pains as it transitions it&#039;s business model. There are times where organizations can be downright vindictive with each other, which really doesn&#039;t help the people get meaningful work done. It&#039;s important to understand the relationships and goals of partner teams well before trying to collaborate across the org.</p> 
review474: *Department was new a somewhat unorganized, so I did not have a clear goal or set of tasks *Similarly, onboarding process was confusing and unorganized *Payroll manager (through the consulting firm Amplify) was difficult to work with *Many of the projects I was working on required more than my set 10 hours/week *Somewhat isolated from the rest of the team and other employees at Microsoft (mostly due to the nature of my chosen projects)</p> 
review475: None I can think of</p> 
review476: Focus on making quota is overwhelming at times. Much of the sales and account planning is license driven.</p> 
review477: Though it has improved with the new CEO and the product lines aren&#039;t competing as much anymore, there are still silos where duplicate engineering systems exist, representing a waste of time and resources when compared to our competitors</p> 
review478: Inhouse technologies dont always catch up with the best available.</p> 
review478: Very political and not transparent in terms of reviews and rewards. If you are not liked by your manager or if your manager is not strong, you will not be successful. Lots of big egos. Not a place where Microsoft is investing.</p> 
review479: Unfortunately, if you get a bad manager (which definitely does happen) you&#039;&#039;ll be wondering why you ever wanted to come and work for this company. This does apply to any company but I&#039;ve seen great people who were smart, hard working and collobrative either get managed out of the company or just end up leaving due to sheer frustration because of really bad managers.</p> 
review480: lack of infrastructure to deploy projects on emerging countries</p> 
review481: There is so much work to do that you could spend all day and weekend working. They expect you to be available 24/7 if something happens. Very common to work on weekends.</p> 
review482: Salary is through government program (minimum wage) Not a lot of opportunities available for permanency</p> 
review483: Too many people. Too many meetings. Too many layers of communication.</p> 
review484: Career mobility is extremely limited if you are located outside of Redmond.</p> 
review485: No free food. You have to use all Microsoft tools, even for areas where Microsoft is not good at, which limits the tool choice.</p> 
review486: Pretty much top down in my experience. Though they are making a lot of changes they always seem to play catch up.</p> 
review487: Microsoft leadership has become too reluctant to part with archaic performance management practices, to the point of sacrificing months of productive time per year from talented, capable contributors who must engage in and recover from meaningless feedback cycles that sap enthusiasm and progress.</p> 
review487: Store manager is left to run amok and treats his staff as if they are unqualified to breath his air. Constantly berated employees in front of coworkers as well as in front of customers. Reported to HR for months and nothing was done to address the issue.</p> 
review488: Tough if you are an Ops person working in Enginnering org, as management doesn&#039;t understand or appreciate the value of Ops skills.</p> 
review489: They say the stack rank system is gone but its just renamed. It might be a little different this year but the employees have all be conditioned to be rockstars and make fellow workers look bad to get a bigger checks. Talk to people that have been there and they will confirm its a pressure cooker. Get in and get out in a few years.</p> 
review490: Changes in business cycles and technology trends can lead to swift and massive layoffs. However, layoff packages are generous and include outplacement and career transition services.</p> 
review491: Coworkers don&#039;t talk to each other that much. The cafeteria is gross. But it totally depends on the building you are in.</p> 
review492: None, really. The current management is awesome.</p> 
review493: Need more innovations Better reactions to user feedback</p> 
review494: You have to make strategic alignments to keep your job. Its not at all about performance or &#034;Doing the right thing&#034; trust me...</p> 
review495: Many leaders and peers were not interested in each others well being at all.</p> 
review496: Nothing I don&#039;t think any cons or negatives May be little traditional and dominated by full timers Managers are authoritative</p> 
review496: In an effort to try remain relevant the company has become more of a follower than a leader. However this provides opportunity to those who can bring the latest and greatest in leadership.</p> 
review497: Having to please 6 customers at once.</p> 
review498: Terrible leadership, tough politics, favoritism, and a leadership team that focuses too much on &#034;ever onward&#034; without ever delivering on it.</p> 
review499: big company, culture can be difficult</p> 
review500: I do not have any cons for this company.</p> 
review501: Quotas go up every year by 20%.</p> 
review502: Big company structure, large corporate ladder, disjoint at times with management as a whole</p> 
review503: Being on call can suck, they got rid of a lot of the in person training (hopefully they bring that back soon).</p> 
review504: Stress, long hours, expectation to be on e-mail 18 hours a day, 7 days a week. Too busy with little things at work, not enough time to focus on larger projects.</p> 
review505: Engineering often gets lost in trying to solve too many problems at once. Not enough focus on engineering quality and efficiencies, but getting better with renewed focus from leadership. Review system has become blah with the latest update.</p> 
review505: 1) Still has a stack ranking system to get rid of people even if they did a good job. They just don&#039;t call it that anymore. To survive, you need to the best on worst team. ie. Someone needs to be having a worse time than you. 2) Everything global so early morning and late evening plus weekends working. 3) Everything is very complex to change or integrate.</p> 
review506: The environment can be brutal with people who are more interested in looking out for themselves than they are the team. The company continues to operate in a stack rank mentality of giving the best rewards to the highest performers and managing the weaker performers out of the company. The company is also in a time of transformation which means that you&#039;ll constantly have new leadership. Constantly changing priorities and goals can make it difficult to deliver unless you are great a managing corporate politics.</p> 
review507: Constant churn and reorganizations. It&#039;s not uncommon to have 3 or 4 reorganizations per year and a new manager each time. One VP centralizes everything and then a few months later the next decentralizes and you end up in a constant cycle of back and forth between the two. So much productivity is lost with constant churn.</p> 
review508: Management, at least at my store, does not have passion for what they do and do a poor job of managing employees in general</p> 
review509: Limited internal business execution performance. Highly-vertical / silo company (like 6 separate companies within a company). Redundancies in roles/responsibilities with legacy culture that has not learned how to leverage end-to-end cross-functional value. The good news, new leadership is fully aware and is driving company horizontally (to align with end-customer) vs. product. It&#039;s a painful process that will take time.</p> 
review510: - The compensation side of the current annual review system still needs refinement. Compensation ratings are relative vs. peers -- which is arguably necessary, given budget realities -- but divisions vary in how they allocate rewards across the rating spread, and the results are not always fair to all involved.</p> 
review511: Old processes but changing rapidly now</p> 
review512: Bureaucratic. Example: if you need to purchase non-Microsoft software to do your job, the process can take 6 weeks. Generally you will feel as though none of your ideas actually get shipped and that can make your work feel meaningless. Overall company culture is insulated from the rest of the technology sector and still living in the 90s. Example: employees attacking other employees on Yammer for owning iPhones (instead of Windows Phones). The path to advancing and becoming a manager is incredibly long. It seems like it would be faster to leave, advance to a management position elsewhere, then come back and leverage a higher position that way.</p> 
review513: Not very challenging work and work and career is mostly driven by your manager and the management change</p> 
review514: No more all paid for health insurance 50-60 Hr week is a norm</p> 
review514: too new to know which way it will go</p> 
review515: The managers tend to be bad. Don&#039;t know any other way to put it. The senior management has no clue the lower managers are so awful so it never gets addresses, or they know and don&#039;t care. Not all managers are bad, but I would say at least 65% are really not quality managers but Microsoft will promote them up the rank which makes me think they may be encouraging the bad behavior. Let me give you and example...Female/married coworker had a manager making inappropriate inquires into her personal life via another manager. Instead of that manager shutting him down he gave him the information and then told her he was asking about it.</p> 
review516: Hard environment to collaborate. If you have the wrong leader, they can make the organization a painful place to work</p> 
review517: Perks and compensation are not as good as in other top tech companies</p> 
review518: There are many managers within the company who really shouldn&#039;t be managers. Having a manager who cares more about their own career development or one who doesn&#039;t understand how to navigate the political landscape can really set your career back.</p> 
review519: lots of meetings every day</p> 
review520: The Management Style is dramatically changing and people with any time are being pushed out.</p> 
review521: bureaucratic, big, heavy, old, outdate</p> 
review522: Compared to other companies of its class, I felt a lack of entrepreneurial spirit amongst employees at Microsoft. Plus working at Microsoft doesn&#039;t really prepare you for your own startup - from both a tech and business standpoint.</p> 
review523: systems and tools to get day to day work done are sometimes sub par. Management reporting and score card focused which can sometimes lead to myopic internal focus rather than customer focus. Culture is very email and IM centric for communication. Not as much face to face collaboration as I&#039;d like. Cross team/org collaboration is a challenge as the company continues to expand.</p> 
review523: Not very agile, even thought things have been changing recently.</p> 
review524: Very limited organizational structure which makes it hard to get things approved</p> 
review525: Options for career advancement as an admin are severely limited.</p> 
review526: restrictive company, hard to find a place where you do what you love, the review process does not work.</p> 
review527: Note: Microsoft is &lt;b&gt;huge&lt;/b&gt;, each department has its own culture and pros &amp; cons, so a lot of the complaints below are specific to the Online Service Division or Bing Ads. - Management styles in Bing Ads are harsh to the point of being unrealistic. The leadership team is certainly competent, and we&#039;ve made major improvements to both our product and business strategy since I started. However, they&#039;re prone to setting unrealistic deadlines and punishing people for failure regardless of whether that person had any control over the source of the delay. It&#039;s very difficult to ask for clarification of goals or explain why it&#039;s infeasible to implement the plan in the time allotted, because the manager will often dismiss the problem and imply you&#039;re stupid for asking. Their overall attitude is &#039;Make it work, or we&#039;ll find someone who will.&#039; - MSFT&#039;s code base and bureaucracy are both huge and old (by tech industry standards). I recently wanted to change the text of a few links on one of our websites. It took three months to a.) identify the dev lead who owned the code (because ownership changed three times in three months), b.) identify the developer with access permissions to deploy the changes, and c.) get the new text approved by our cloud of business groups. In another case, it took a month to figure out which person had the authority to approve emails to customers. Both the people and the process needed for any given task change every 1-2 years, and the documentation is rarely updated completely or quickly. To be fair, the company has gotten much better about this in the last few years, but PMs still spend half their time tracking down the right person/system. - Engineering attracts a very distinctive personality type. Whenever you make a mistake, which will be often during the first several months due to the sheer amount of new information to process, people will point it out very bluntly. You can also expect to debate the details of essentially every decision. - There&#039;s an implicit assumption that if you&#039;re unhappy or can&#039;t met the goals set for you, you&#039;re just not smart/hard-working enough to make it at Microsoft. This creates an Emperor&#039;s new clothes situation where problems don&#039;t get fixed because everyone&#039;s afraid to report them.</p> 
review528: As a contractor (if applicable) you receive no benefits, limited or no formal training, no career path and at times you are not invited to &#034;internal only&#034; business meetings that affect your productivity and make you feel like an outsider. Microsoft does not offer contractors a mechanism to get hired (only thru good connections and the public web site).</p> 
review529: Still too focus on processes in some areas. Not enough coaching for people transitioning between discipline.</p> 
review530: Since the company is so large, people move around a lot. It can be very competitive.</p> 
review531: Like I said, sometimes felt too big. Was hard to know everything that was going on, and some decisions felt like they were top down. But this was rare and for the most part the company believed in hiring bright people and letting them run with things</p> 
review532: Layoffs in 2014 really hurt office morale the year I was there. Obviously it&#039;s a complicated situation, but it sucks for people to be laid off and to hear stuff like &#034;didn&#039;t meet profit expectations&#034; when the company is netting $20 billion a year in income. You&#039;re forced to become a MS tech evangelist (hide your iPhones).</p> 
review532: randomization, too many layers, re-orgs</p> 
review533: New system so issues with POS, supply lookup, pickup, pre-order, and shipping are present at a store level that always pose issues.</p> 
review534: I honestly can&#039;t think of too many. Some older internal processes are a little inefficient and annoying but they are getting replaced in almost all cases with newer, better systems/processes.</p> 
review535: Many, many, many changes in organization structure, staff, and process with little documentation. No clear objectives communicated. Issues with staff morale.</p> 
review536: Most of the time pace does not support balance between work and life. At a LOB level, change is not well thought through and even after a year of significant changes in org. structures turmoil continues.</p> 
review537: It is still a big company that has a hard time getting out of it&#039;s own way. It also becomes &#034;thin air&#034; once you get to the upper middle management ranks and hard to move up.</p> 
review538: The review system makes you focus less on doing real work and doing more to manage your career.</p> 
review539: Layoffs can impact even great performers if the company is going through a restructuring.</p> 
review540: Being a remote employee and not willing to relocate to Seattle was limiting in terms of opportunities and career growth. Management priorities were clear, though shifted a lot, making it hard to know whether you were working on priority work.</p> 
review541: very political environment, review and reward varies greatly across product group. Decisions are made top down, an environment that doesn&#039;t encourage creativity at all levels.</p> 
review541: Most of the time pace does not support balance between work and life. At a LOB level, change is not well thought through and even after a year of significant changes in org. structures turmoil continues.</p> 
review542: It is still a big company that has a hard time getting out of it&#039;s own way. It also becomes &#034;thin air&#034; once you get to the upper middle management ranks and hard to move up.</p> 
review543: A bit more corporate than many Seattle-based companies</p> 
review544: Not any cons from my observation.</p> 
review545: TBD TBD TBD TBD TBD</p> 
review546: Management is the worse I&#039;ve never experienced such a degrading environment as I experienced at this store. Management seems to think they have to break you down and they never build you up.</p> 
review547: A ton of change Yahoo/BIng agreement change was sloppy, poorly managed, and impacted negatively Commission taken away for the year Incompetent mid-management Review practices are ridiculous</p> 
review548: constant re-org corporation culture does not really encourage people to collaborate, too competitive company is no longer growing</p> 
review549: Not so much reference materials for designers. Not all designers knows about everything about the project.</p> 
review550: Management and the temp agency I was working with never communicated. Also pay varied by gender, which was not Microsoft&#039;s fault but the contracting company, Insight Global.</p> 
review550: Not so much reference materials for designers. Not all designers knows about everything about the project.</p> 
review551: Management and the temp agency I was working with never communicated. Also pay varied by gender, which was not Microsoft&#039;s fault but the contracting company, Insight Global.</p> 
review552: If you work in Mountain View you are away from the decision making center.</p> 
review553: if you can tackle the pressure.................</p> 
review554: 1) No cons, whatsoever. Although, for some reason people believe that Microsoft is a place to retire. And you lose your skills after going there.</p> 
review555: there is no cons for MSR</p> 
review556: Processes and structure can come in the way of fast growth. Lot of bloated middle management.</p> 
review557: A lot of scars from previous administrations and not in the Bay Area combine for both an internal and external brand equity problem. The team is light years ahead of where the market is and simply needs to wait for the world to catch up. Sometimes they are trying out new things that simply don&#039;t work, folks don&#039;t expect that kind of risk taking from such a large organization.</p> 
review558: Sorry Microsoft - but nothing has changed since I Ieft. In fact, given the horror stories I hear when I meet with colleagues still working there - the forced ranking is still there: zero bonuses even when goals are exceeded. No tolerance for employees that want to take career risks and try new areas for growth: if the fit turns out to be a poor fit - you are labeled &#034;no internal moves&#034; and you time at MS is over. Last, there is a strong tendency for Indians to hire Indians - look at some of the teams - is there really such a sad lack of diverse folk that could be hired into each team?</p> 
review559: didn&#039;t find many cons at this program</p> 
review559: Red tape evident for a company this big and old.</p> 
review560: Can&#039;t get overwhelming at times</p> 
review561: The Management in the store is terrible. Some don&#039;t know how to manage and others hate you coming up to them with problems ( But that&#039;s the reason they are managers to fix the problems) The Management only sees the bad. When it comes to certain managers whenever something good is done there is no recognition for the great work.</p> 
review562: There is no shortcoming currently, I am just a graduate student and feel great honor to work in such a good company.</p> 
review563: Culture is rough and overly regimented. I mean Jesus did you see some of the polices around reviews in the past and on employee mis classifications, only place your LT will frown on you for treating a contractor who does real work important to the company like a colleague. I mean there is a lot of detachment from the real world but who knows that maybe a good thing to some degree.</p> 
review564: I don&#039;t have a comment about down sides.</p> 
review565: There are simply too many people here, HR performance review model promotes backstabbing, putting fellow employees down, and discourages collaboration. Due to the lack of meaningful individual contributor work that allows employees to go past a certain career level, most people have to switch track to management in order to continue to advance, or switch job functional roles for no pay increase and somewhat of a &#039;perceived&#039; career progression. The end result is that there are a lot of people who are new at what they are doing, and a sea of middle layer management that does nothing. A sad place for a technology company to be when you have managers with 1 or 2 reports only and the report hierarchy is 5-6 levels deep within the same single organization. Furthermore the performance review does not allow the existence of a group of people who are achieving at similar level. Someone must be put down - so in that situation, your personal relationship with the management above you become super important. Basically, if you manage up well, you will win, if you don&#039;t, even if you are a good performer, you will most likely lose in this company.</p> 
review566: quality of life and amount of travel</p> 
review567: I can&#039;t think of any &#039;cons&#039; other than issues that all companies can have: - in my particular org, I&#039;m not very happy with the decisions that management makes. - the layoffs have been hard to swallow over the last couple years.</p> 
review568: So matrixed, it is really hard to get things done. Decision rights unclear. Lots of waste, due lack of focus on process or focusing on wrong results. Politics and competitiveness between groups is pretty awful, but getting better</p> 
review568: Work life balance is not great.</p> 
review569: As a contract worker there is a subtle discrimination against you from full-time employees. I have been on both sides of the issue, blue badge is way better experience than orange badge.</p> 
review570: Frequent reorgs resulting in instability and insecurity. Mid and lower level management seems lost in the transformation process, with their focus mainly on finding a secure place for themselves, and less on guiding their org through the new changes.Data culture is still missing. Success depends more on how you manage up versus what you deliver and impact. &#034;Impact&#034;, &#034;Consumption&#034; are more of buzzwords, since most of the activities and core skillsets of the people still remain the same (old wine in new bottle). Integrity of many of the success metrics used are questionable. Customer focus was never a core strength, and the current transformation has only distracted the business further from it.</p> 
review571: Can get stuck in a quagmire of politics because the company is so large. At times, it can feel like the company is slow to respond to competitive shifts.</p> 
review572: Lots of office politics at the managerial and maybe more senior employees levels. It use to be harder to move around within Microsoft then to find opportunities elsewhere. I heard they may have changed it since 2014.</p> 
review573: Location is in Redmond, instead of where the fun happens (Seattle).</p> 
review574: I cant think of any. Very Strong company</p> 
review575: Products not always super sexy. Huge company and easy to get lost. Competitive.</p> 
review576: Benefits are slightly under par when compared to Google or Facebook</p> 
review577: Non-Collaborative work environment. You are on your own.</p> 
review577: With the new 18 month rule in place, for those who have made a career contracting at Microsoft, one is now required to take mandatory time off after 18 months of consecutive work. The work around is to find a Managed Service contract. Another con is depending on your consulting company, you may be on your own for benefit and taxes.</p> 
review578: It is hard to rise and get promoted to managerial positions. Relaxed culture (could be a benefit), doesn&#039;t push you too hard to get out of your comfort zone.</p> 
review579: Too big and too many people</p> 
review580: none to speak of for now</p> 
review581: Culture focused on titles, very siloed, no work life balance</p> 
review582: Can be lots of politics. The annual review process is very opaque.</p> 
review583: -Everything moves slowly -Reviews are still tiered despite what they tell you -No collaboration between teams, each team feels like an entirely different org</p> 
review584: Stack ranking motivates bad behaviors.</p> 
review585: Red Tape and slow in decision making</p> 
review586: MS is moving towards more &#034;agile&#034; methods, but it&#039;s still a rather sluggish form of agility - heading in the right direction, but decisions/actions will never be as fast as they would be at a smaller newer org.</p> 
review586: Lot&#039;s of organizational change all the time since I&#039;ve been here. Although it&#039;s for the better.</p> 
review587: Although microsoft research had an open culture, I still feel that I have no idea of what other groups were doing.</p> 
review588: Nothing much, typical experience working at a big company .</p> 
review589: Shark tank politics, your worth is dependent on your &#034;promotional velocity&#034; (HR&#039;s term!), you will always be graded on a curve - the curve just doesn&#039;t have a fixed shape anymore. Rewards are still angled towards Hero Coders - and make no mistake, the company is still dependent on them.</p> 
review590: The layoffs have pushed out the best people with the best cultural attributes, and only the toxic barnacles stay on (okay, the layoffs did get rid of some IC barnacles, but every toxic middle manager was spared). If you&#039;re innovative and a risk-taker do not go there - you will be crushed. Also, despite the talk, it is not a &#039;meritocracy&#039; - it&#039;s all about politics and gamesmanship. There are far better companies with much better cultures around - go there.</p> 
review591: too much compliance and slow decision make pocess</p> 
review592: The management team in the Pub Sec Consulting division is horrible. Too high on cronyism and nepotism. The review process is still totally screwed up...so nebulous that you never truly know where you stand. The forced attrition model is still alive and well...don&#039;t let anyone tell you differently. I witnessed several long term staff (one with 18 years of tenure) get sent packing with nothing but a boot print on their rears. No package/severance at all. These were not weak performers...you don&#039;t make it 8, 12, 18 years at MSFT being a weak performer. There is forced attrition and once you are on the list, you are not getting off. The bonuses for Utilization and CPE (Customer Partner Experience) have been manipulated by HR again this year. The numbers are now tied directly to a team number. Does not matter how good you are...if you have a slacker on your team you pay the price. The health benefits used to be incredible. Now they are just average.</p> 
review593: There are political messes all over the place.</p> 
review594: All the recent layoffs ... A company like Microsoft should take of the employees, particularly when (most, if not all) employees love working there and put their heart and soul to good work.</p> 
review595: Only con is working on holidays and weekends.</p> 
review595: I dont find any cons in this job so dont know what to wirte</p> 
review596: Work Life balance is sometimes non existent Promotions are more based on who you know, rather than what you bring to the table.</p> 
review597: Salaries are lower than comparable companies in the Seattle Washington area. Management style can be a little rough. Especially for newcomers. It takes time to earn trust.</p> 
review598: no one tells you how to take advantage of your benefits, the stores are in busy shopping malls.</p> 
review599: - Team Collaboration is not great. Too much focus on individual contribution for performance evaluation</p> 
review600: Nothing as i know except some politics of managers</p> 
review601: internal focused with a lot of reviews internal promotion takes a long time</p> 
review602: Too much politics and beurocracy ( often times more time is spent arguing about whether or not to do something, than it would take to just do it! ) Copying Google in too many ways</p> 
review603: Too Big a corporation for fast growth</p> 
review604: Too much politics. Not good to get Pregnant and have babies.</p> 
review604: politics, some managers are really very bad individual contributor,</p> 
review605: Bureaucracy was brutal. This meant at times nothing could get done because too many people needed to have an opinion on how to solve the problem. There were also long periods of wasted efforts formatting PPTX after PPTX with no reasons given as to why the edits were needed. So there was not an opportunity to learn and improve.</p> 
review606: The pain is that you need deal with much legacy stuff. Inter-operation among teams is not very effective.</p> 
review607: You have to be in the right group there. Since it is such a big company, there are a lot of small groups that hardly do any tangible work and there are some managers who just get away with anything. They are not answerable to anyone. HR is really very weak and doesn&#039;t do anything to support an employee. There is a lot of politics and bureaucracy which is really sad!!!</p> 
review608: This isn&#039;t really a con, but to be successful at Microsoft you have to be an information seeker, and not expect things to just be done for you. Microsoft hires the best, and expects you to come to the table with something to offer.</p> 
review609: Really no cons whatsoever, they&#039;re awesome!</p> 
review610: Very demanding work load and not much autonomy.</p> 
review611: The pay is very low however the requirements for the position are also low, so you can start without any knowledge... and so is your colleges. The average knowledge of the staff is very low up to the SME position.</p> 
review612: Corporation going through many changes, divisions are in silos hence not much inter-division interaction</p> 
review613: 1. Everyone is working hard to better themselves, which means whether you work as a team or not, your impact is heavily weighed. You are constantly being evaluated and expected to grow as an employee-- and sometimes when you&#039;re hired from the outside and not thoroughly trained like in-sourced hires, you can feel like you&#039;re at a disadvantage or expected to know things that you haven&#039;t been trained for. This is not a job for those who are entry-level to the retail industry or the workforce in general. 2. Work/Life balance constraints: MSFT goes out of its way to make sure everyone is being worked at the minimum standard of 20 hours p. week (part-timers) which means that if you&#039;re going to school full time, working another job, or just have personal obligations, you need to be prepared to: A) Get two days off a week that will not be consecutive and B) Know your personal life 3 weeks in advance so you can request time off. For school this is especially difficult, because there are always opportunities outside of the classroom for E.C or even graded requirements. They can only be so lenient, and this is always going to be determined by 1) how good you are as an employee and 2) everyone else&#039;s availability.</p> 
review613: Environment is too comfortable. Too big. Much red tape. Colleagues of varying skill levels.</p> 
review614: Quotas are set so high they are unachievable. So if you can&#039;t live on your base, I would not recommend it as a place to work. Field management has lack of leadership and vision.</p> 
review615: Social life is not very great in many groups in Microsoft and the competition between team members is not very cool sometimes.</p> 
review616: No work/life balance. If you do not belong to a certain culture, you will not be hired, or they will push you out if you are already in. It&#039;s become a very racist toxic environment Doing your job very well is not enough anymore.</p> 
review617: Like most big companies it really depends on which group you are in. Some are great some not so great. Moving around groups has recently become easier which is good.</p> 
review618: I didn&#039;t have the same experience in MS Office. Lack of flexibility</p> 
review619: smart people starts to leave ;( No free food</p> 
review620: n/a .</p> 
review621: Isolated atmosphere. Brand image is not as competitive as before. Some legacy of the past management structures still dragging the company.</p> 
review622: Long work days, occasional bad manger will kill your career</p> 
review622: Long work days, occasional bad manger will kill your career</p> 
review623: 1. Some team has a little bit heavy process. 2. The control right of manager is still high</p> 
review624: Limited opportunities at remote sites.</p> 
review625: Very little career advancement. Need to be outside hire to get into management. They will not promote from within.No time allowed for vacation. Management and account teams won&#039;t let their field employees take any time off or even work with them when they have a death in their family. I had to work the day I lost my parent and while I was trying to arrange and have the funeral. Microsoft has no heart.</p> 
review626: The finance organization is a sexist environment. I would discourage talented females for joining the finance role. The environment is one that does not foster an open dialogue. The SMSG organization still has a stacked-ranking culture. The culture is more competitive than collaborative. Hierarchical in structure. This is one of the most political environments of all Fortune 500 companies. If you prefer to be in a more meritocratic culture, join Amazon.</p> 
review627: Old-school management style kills work culture. New direction from CEO, but no real change in work culture. What can you do for me. No coaching, no development. Use them up for what they can do for you, give them more and more work. Employees with budget (aka vendor support, shadow work force) have more opportunity.</p> 
review628: Is still a sales oriented company and difficult to move away from the old licensing model that is scaring customers away.</p> 
review629: Middle management is not usually bought into One Microsoft Still waaaaaaay to political The Stack Ranking may be gone but it is still being done</p> 
review630: - Several of the changes are not appropriate</p> 
review631: The level system is a nightmare if you come on low and want to move up. I made the mistake of coming at a level that&#039;s was too low for me to get a new role despite being well qualified for it. Stack ranking, and don&#039;t believe it when they tell you it doesn&#039;t exist anymore, means good employees will have to be seen as failures because someone has to. Management has a lot of leeway to do as they please and even if you&#039;ve always been a high performer, you can get a manager that doesn&#039;t like you and your career will suffer greatly for it. I left the company 2 years ago and now work in a role where I&#039;m a top performer, doing what I&#039;m good at, and making $20k a year more.</p> 
review631: Need to move faster, be innovative.</p> 
review632: Work Life balance is not great.</p> 
review633: Many teams have too much process and are too focused on the software development process, and less on the end product. Innovation can be difficult in the well established products (Windows, Office, ...).</p> 
review634: Depending on the team, there can be a lot of politics and bad work life balance.</p> 
review635: Jumping into new position is not easy.</p> 
review636: It&#039;s hard to feel a good product is ever produced because of how many people weigh in on the design decisions.</p> 
review637: Not enough team synergy and collaboration.</p> 
review638: An excellent engineer doesn&#039;t necessarily make a good manager. This is a lesson that has eluded Microsoft for decades. I&#039;ve seen many rock-stars in the making walk out because of used-to-be-engineer managers who haven&#039;t quite been able to let go. That said, there are plenty of excellent managers here. When you find one, stick with her/him.</p> 
review639: I have no complaints so far!</p> 
review640: - a lot of &#034;big corporation&#034; things like meetings, reorgs, etc.</p> 
review640: Not much new investment going on, hardly any new products coming up unlike in 1990s. Most product areas don&#039;t seem to have strong visionaries compared to leadership at other companies.</p> 
review641: Way too many MSFT VP&#039;s down to managers with 20 years of experience. They have no idea how anything is done in the real world. Not uncommon to be asked to use 20-40 different systems, excel spreadsheets, etc. to try and do your job. Bill Gates set up a complicated organization of Fiefdoms where GM&#039;s all have P&amp;L based performance bonuses, causing a lot of Penny-wise, pound-foolish behavior. Internal Manager training is HORRIBLE. No growth paths are defined, managers have carte blanch to cut comp, invent poor performance ratings, etc... HR function has no authority and will not back up anyone who is being mistreated.</p> 
review642: Can&#039;t think of anything in particular.</p> 
review643: Old review system contributed to an excessive individual work environment instead of collaborative.</p> 
review644: Big Company culture, politics, might be lost in the crowd</p> 
review645: too many old guard folks that are just coasting into retirement, skews much older than most tech companies</p> 
review646: Long working hours at times, hard to balance work and personal life. Location has a lot of rain and can be difficult winters without sun.</p> 
review647: This became a shark infested environment once Ballmer took over. It reflected his persona which was simply mean, mean and more mean. I&#039;ve never seen such poor collaboration among employees, back stabbing and personal agendas. Ballmer took the curve and publicized it in a way that just caused people to act like they were in a concentration camp. It&#039;s me or the other guy. People from India thrive in this kind of environment and that&#039;s what you have today, a company run by Indian nationals in a very conformist environment.</p> 
review648: Work ethic Unbalance between personal life and work Technologies Contraints</p> 
review649: Organization changes occur with too much regularity. At times it seemed like the company didn&#039;t get the concept &#039;If it isn&#039;t broke don&#039;t fix it.&#039; This led to a pervasive feeling of keeping one&#039;s head down and just focus on the work to avoid getting caught up in the politics. While that may be a normal state of affairs it often trespassed into distraction.</p> 
review649: Depends on what team you are on, you may have limited room for tech growth. But you are always free to switch teams. Pay is average at start, but gives you a good foothold for future career</p> 
review650: Terrible management. Ballmer was an immense embarrassment to the entire company other than his cronies. In particular, his copying of Jack Welch&#039;s &#034;someone must be a terrible employee&#034; review process was a total disaster for morale among the employees.</p> 
review651: Sometimes I feel like it has a contested feel to it with how many people work there and it can seem crowded sometimes.</p> 
review652: Collaboration between teams needs more work and as we are enforcing One Microsoft this is getting better</p> 
review653: Less than competent management. Lots of two faced and political action (honesty not valued). Projects that do nothing other than spend money and keep people busy. Many of the FTE&#039;s (particularly middle management) are unethical.</p> 
review654: Terrible on boarding experience with HR and benefits. Some groups still have a feeling of competition with each other despite the changes review and reward format.</p> 
review655: The product management is heavily geared towards engineering types, without enough training in (or respect for) design. It means that decisions are often made from a technical standpoint, or with a flawed design point of view.</p> 
review656: Review system is not up to par</p> 
review657: Things change often, and they do a lot of re-organization of orgs, teams, groups or whatever. The company is very Redmond, Washington focused although it does have a global footprint.</p> 
review658: Review system, politics, continuous investment in yesterdays news</p> 
review658: Culture is somewhat ignorant about and/or resistant to use tools everyone else in the world uses. Often choosing to build its own internal tool in-house that is either buggy, &#034;special&#034; in interface, or just outdated. Examples: build tools, source depot, various test frameworks Working from home (from a fiber optic connection in Redmond!) is stunningly unrelaible and inefficient, at least for general development work on a large codebase. Process to approve contributing to open source on your freetime is relatively cumbersome</p> 
review659: A little slow working environment. Learning curve is huge</p> 
review660: Not always the greatest place if you want work life balance</p> 
review661: Top managed from Redmond - Satellite office, despite being quite large, had little autonomy. Yearly re-orgs and constant management re-shuffling. Corporate climate is more competitive and adversarial than collaboratory. Although it kept you on your toes, I believe it is detrimental for achieving the overall goals of the company.</p> 
review662: now run by windows lifers and people who just dont get gaming. Only good guy left is Phil Spencer but even he cannot keep the Windows GMs at bay in their effort to absorb the last fun thing about mincrosoft</p> 
review663: Management culture is very unique. There is a tendency to blame the people instead of the process or systemic shortcomings that need to be corrected.</p> 
review664: I would like to meet ALL of the Employees.</p> 
review665: No transparency in performance review system. They eliminated the forced curve and labeling of employees. Managers now have full control. He can say that you performed very well but give very little bonus and blame the budget. Words need not translate into actions. Very difficult to transfer internally to other divisions. It is easier to find a job outside than move within Microsoft.</p> 
review666: As an artist you would expect to be making great art. That&#039;s not the case at Turn 10. All the fun content creation is outsourced to India and Vietnam. At Turn 10 the artist basically polish and refine the assets that the vendors return. It&#039;s often tedious and boring work. On occasion you would have to model or texture something that was missed or incorrect but most of the time you were just touching up something. The other problem with working at Turn 10 and Microsoft in general is they don&#039;t tend to hire full time. It&#039;s contracts only. If you&#039;re good and the team likes you there&#039;s a good chance they will hire you back for another contract but if stability is what you&#039;re after stay away from Microsoft/Turn 10. Also, you don&#039;t actually work for Microsoft you work for an outsource agency that hires you out to Microsoft. This way Microsoft doesn&#039;t have to pay you benefits or profit sharing. You can get benefits from your agency but probably not as good as Microsoft gives to its actual employees.</p> 
review667: High pressure, too much work to do, slow decision making (though better than in the past)</p> 
review667: Lots of change at the company these days. Comfort with this level of change is a must to be successful.</p> 
review668: * Review system is getting better but still remains of the bad system. * Company is still having issues competing with competitors.</p> 
review669: Lots of administrative tasks to complete, such as time reporting, compliance training</p> 
review670: Massive and often complex</p> 
review671: Sometimes the work is not the most exciting</p> 
review672: No free food for the peeps</p> 
review673: MS-IT will use employees to test product release (eg. force windows 10 update, force office 2016 update, followed by forced restart) As a Engineer I have many programs open, vm&#039;s running, and sometimes the updates can put a cramp in my day.</p> 
review674: Lot&#039;s of internal problems. Lot&#039;s of turnover plus never allowed to manage the same account for years at a time.</p> 
review675: The office is in the downtown, however, the parking lot is small and not much space. The instruction was not clear most of the time.</p> 
review676: Big organization, slow to change</p> 
review676: Innovation gets scuttled by multi layers of management. In some teams, politics and death marches are a severe challenge. In short, if you don&#039;t get the right team, you can have a difficult job. Compensation, raises and benefits are not impressive.</p> 
review677: Some (but not all) managers have poor technical expertise. Most managers never code and never look at code. Lots of politics and shady agreements between managers that surface up later in surprising ways. Many projects move relatively slow, with some exceptions. Some people moving from team to team leaving subpar quality behind them.</p> 
review678: Not a fun environment Poor management Culture lacks integrity and honesty Cut throat, stack ranking culture - even though they changed the rating system, it still stack ranks.</p> 
review679: During the past leadership, not a lot of vision or follow-through. Current COO is a dinosaur and should be &#034;moved on&#034;.</p> 
review680: Constantly behind the curve, which generally leaves them out of the conversation. Once you don&#039;t work there it&#039;s surprising how little you hear of them in the media. They&#039;ve grown to be a normal stodgy corporation, far more IBM than Google. Not a place to be if you&#039;re looking to do cutting edge work. They&#039;ve moved a bit away from stack ranking as a review process, but at last count somebody still has to lose for somebody else to win.</p> 
review681: Cross-org collaboration is a slog. Too many layers of upper management. Too much discussing vs. just doing. Not enough women in senior roles.</p> 
review682: Managers - I have had 2 bad managers out of 3 total. They don&#039;t promote the right people into people management roles which is a bummer since it ruins your experience of working at the company. I don&#039;t think this is fixable at this stage since the rot has set in.</p> 
review683: Working with other departments (e.g. Windows, Office, Exchange, etc.) is an absolute nightmare. Most cross-department coordination engineering meetings tend to end in rage, tears, or near-bloodshed. BENCH/HiPo/Lab365 status is the only way for compensation to be truly competitive with other top-tier companies like Google and Facebook.</p> 
review684: Very complex, political company. Some bad managers can hinder a career.</p> 
review685: Tough culture, most people switch roles every few years so always movement</p> 
review685: Still too slow in some parts of the company. But things are improving. The public may be viewing Microsoft as old news so there are some perception issues to overcome.</p> 
review686: As a Creative, it was hard at review time - Creative KPI&#039;s are somewhat intangible - which makes it hard to prove your value add to the company.</p> 
review687: I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s just being in Seattle or at Microsoft or a combination, but I&#039;ve never seen so much passive-aggressiveness in one building before; I&#039;m surprised it didn&#039;t collapse on itself like a dying friggin&#039; star. If you have any kind of a big personality be careful, because it will be used against you.</p> 
review688: no enough opportunities for advancement, Store Management need to communicate better,</p> 
review689: Management babysits too much, scheduling meetings all the time, very cut throat at times, show-offs and know it all&#039;s.</p> 
review690: Many teams treat vendors as a lower quality person and don&#039;t dedicate any time to training, this is unmotivational for any employee and causes frustration. Finding a good manager can be a challenge.</p> 
review691: very layered and too many people working on same things</p> 
review692: Development, promotion and recognition of employees</p> 
review693: Everything going downward after the big dev manager was promoted to manage more teams with important projects. A previous lead was hired back to be the new manager. The guy is OK, but definitely not the previous dev manager. The worst thing is that they brought in some &#034;architect&#034; from a bough over small company. The guy doesn&#039;t/cannot code at all and doesn&#039;t want learn neither the code base nor the internal structure of the product. He has no idea what to expect and simply don&#039;t care. He is the worst manager I have ever seen for so many years in the team. The technologies you learnt in some teams, say C++ are not popular outside of the company. You will have to harder time to transfer to other companies or even other teams. Internal transfer to other teams are not as easy as google.</p> 
review694: Organization tends to be unstable. You never know when you will end up on a new team with a new manager. Managers have unlimited power and virtually no accountability. They can make you a star or run you out of the company with virtually no challenge to their reasoning or facts. Great if your manager likes you. Terrible if not. Sadly not all managers are good.</p> 
review694: Salary is lower than many competitors like Facebook, Google, Linkedin, etc. Many projects are in maintenance mode which means you don&#039;t get to innovate much.</p> 
review695: Sometimes, folks just want &amp; need to get work done. Here are some cons &amp; examples of lost productivity: -Career growth: Slow promotions, no defined career trajectory, too many meetings, morale events, reorgs, office moves, unwarranted changes that make focusing on moving forward distracting. -Many employed long-timers do nothing (&amp; happily punt their share of work to new folks). You can bust your butt to be recognized, get a great review and then a minimum cost of living raise with no sign of a promotion, which dis-incentivizes morale and desire to do anything more than status quo (it may be that you&#039;re being compared to the lifers doing as little as possible). -You&#039;re expected to drive your own career. If you ask your Supervisor how to move up, or indicate interest in growing career path, they&#039;ll give you more work to do, with opportunities to learn &amp; then promo doesn&#039;t come to fruition. Policies for internal movement prevent you from leveling up more than one level at a time, so advancement is very slow and if you didn&#039;t start at MS at the beginning of your career, growth seems un-achievable. -For as many &#034;processes&#034; in place, things can be incredibly unorganized. Agility is taken to a new level. Some decisions are deferred or not communicated by upper mgmt, which feels unstable. -Products are released with bugs, causes lots of downtime. Frequent changing/&#034;upgrades&#034; on internal tools/software being rolled out 1/2 baked. Nobody to contact internally to discuss issues or Q&amp;A, but rather, you write an alias and the requests goes unattended for days ...more downtime. -Huge focus on minority groups (women, diversity, culture) and being &#034;politically correct&#034; which creates a bigger divide (ie: you&#039;ll hear folks talking about &#034;women in the workplace&#034; in a context where no real skills are discussed, but rather a person&#039;s gender). -So many programs, events, trainings, meetings, morale events, women&#039;s groups, etc. to *possibly* attend. Some optional &amp; some formalities. You can honestly socialize all day via Yammer groups, internal interest group aliases, social gatherings, meetings, and hallway conversations - granted you have time (must be the lifers who have the time for this?). -Too much (false/forced) emphasis on collaboration. While I see value in teamwork, there&#039;s no individual autonomy (this makes it easy for some to slack while others work OT) around individual outputs, ideas or creativity. Creates a culture of codependency and inequality. -Emphasis on being responsive to Skype (IM), email, office interruptions, meeting invites, etc. (probably b/c everyone&#039;s trying so hard to collaborate). Lots of randomization.</p> 
review696: Doit yourself environment when it comes to IT support. If you are diverse it can feel very lonely, also feels like there are initiatives to rid the company of older employees. Still have stack rank culture</p> 
review697: Terrible management. No team working environment nor did upper level management do anything to encourage it. Software was consistently released before it was ready putting a lot of pressure on support.</p> 
review698: Company is so big that its difficult to know what&#039;s going on in other business units</p> 
review699: There are teams that have really bad managers</p> 
review700: The weather can be difficult for some people, and traffic can be difficult. This is offset by the decent public transportation.</p> 
review701: Management hierarchy is deep, lost in crowd</p> 
review702: Great market opportunities missed early in mobile and search</p> 
review703: Big and old, behind in the consumer space. Having a lot politics. Wrong incentive model. Do not have a good way to evaluate employee success. Lost the edge.</p> 
review703: Frequent change of direction. Lack of communication from upper management.</p> 
review704: A bad manager can ruin your career. Extra expectations to give back to Microsoft outside of taking care of customer.</p> 
review705: High pressure environment. Work life balance doesn&#039;t really exist if you wish to have time with your family. Layoffs will likely continue for this company over the long term due to declining use of PC</p> 
review706: None that I see daily</p> 
review707: Not everyone can fit to the culture</p> 
review708: tough working environment. Competitive and aggressive workplace</p> 
review709: Culture in MS needs to change to compete.</p> 
review710: Culture in transition Typical large organizational issues (cross team collaboration)</p> 
review711: Hours, Stress, Work life balance</p> 
review712: Insane bureaucracy. Getting anything done can sometimes mean &#039;socializing&#039; with dozes of people/groups. For a company of ~100K people its amazing how very very few actually hold the power to make a decision (whether trivial or not). Many jobs you are not actually doing anything meaningful, rather MS wants you to feel it is meaningful, but the job exists solely to talk to another part of the company. Bottom line: things move at a glacial pace and if you are not one of those people with power it can be maddening.</p> 
review712: Demanding environment that encourages competition across groups and directly with colleagues within teams. General lack of transparency from management.</p> 
review713: Competition for opportunities and promotions is hard</p> 
review714: Microsoft has so many resources that they can be very wasteful</p> 
review715: Your career is dependent upon your team, manager, organization, funding, project, peers, etc. There are too many things that could disrupt your career at MS. Forget about innovation. The attitude is to just get by with the bare minimum and a me too product.</p> 
review716: Like any large company, there&#039;s bureaucracy, politics, whatever. Some teams/orgs are better than others. In general I&#039;d avoid the really big ones (Windows, Office, Bing) and find smaller teams that are more nimble and often have better work/life balance and social cohesion. Pay is very good, but many comparative companies likely offer better compensation (Google for sure). Satya is changing the culture, but it&#039;s like moving an aircraft carrier, it takes time and there&#039;s plenty of pockets of resistance from folks who are used to the &#034;old school&#034; Microsoft. It&#039;ll take time to weed most of them out.</p> 
review717: ineffective leaders, line managers shoulder the brunt of the strategic direction and execution while leaders are disconnected</p> 
review718: The team i joined was new at the time. Management pushed people to work at nights and weekends for new releases. Atmosphere was tense. people complaining. not a good place to work in general.</p> 
review719: Lack of marketing budget investment; klugy goals/pay correlation; not a challenger culture</p> 
review720: 1. Poor career management or help (if you know someone who is good and tag along, you grow) 2. Sluggish management structure and decision making in some groups 3. Not the best salary provider, IMO</p> 
review721: Turning from a legendary company to normal company</p> 
review721: Completely subjective review process. No work-life balance. They talk about it, but when you stop dedicating your whole life to work, then you are not having enough global impact...</p> 
review722: Microsoft is no longer an innovator in the tech space and seems to be playing catch up in a lot of the sub-spaces, e.g. mobile.</p> 
review723: Such a big place, so you are one among thousands. No other complaints</p> 
review724: Same problems as rest of tech industry - predominantly male population. Also, company is getting biased against older employees.</p> 
review725: Drinks are mostly soft drinks unlike other top tech companies where they provide smoothies and protein shakes.</p> 
review726: Can be (not always) high pressure, stress, expectations</p> 
review727: I don&#039;t have anything bad to say. Although I do wish we got commission on certain products and if we got a little bit more of an employee discount, but that&#039;s not a big deal.</p> 
review728: At times it seems to be more reactionary to current trends than proactive. PMs and engineers have a heavier weighting than design.</p> 
review729: In the Xbox division work-life balance is a serious problem. Boom-or-bust is the rule and periods of steady, regular hours are rare. You either might as well be on vacation, or you might as well never leave the office. After ten years it became obvious that this is by design. Other divisions are better in this regard. Bureaucracy had gotten worse prior to the shakeup in summer of &#039;14. Hopefully it has been streamlined since. Might not be the best place for top talent to try to get rich. It&#039;s still not clear how Microsoft plans to compete with Google and Apple to regain their status as the stock market&#039;s darling. For SDETs opportunities to advance are thin in some parts of the company.</p> 
review730: Politics. Too much process. Not agile enough</p> 
review730: engineering-driven, bureaucracy, lots of lots of useless PMs who only knows how to talk and take credits from designers</p> 
review731: Redtape and inter-department politics get in the way of getting things done</p> 
review732: difficult to demonstrate work as it relates to pay. promotions can be tough to get unless you have sponsorship (not really based on results) people management opportunities are shrinking as they flatten the org. Dead weight is everywhere in middle management. Not adjusting well to the software+services world</p> 
review733: Could have given free food and better healthcare.</p> 
review734: Support is treated worse than the rest of the company</p> 
review735: None. Had the perfect summer internship.</p> 
review736: Expensive to live there</p> 
review737: Microsoft needs to continue to transform, become more customer-centric and move away from old ways of thinking and doing things.</p> 
review738: Struggle to adapt old products and approach to building software to new demands and techniques No standardized perks for seniority/tenure Inconsistent or lacking direction from senior leadership Bad management isn&#039;t dealt with promptly Inconsistent/cheap infrastructure Pockets of disruptive ego and/or lack of talent</p> 
review739: * If you are in a big org like Office or Windows, chances are you will feel like a cog in a big machine. * No free food. No rest area. Then environment feel not as friendly as those new companies.</p> 
review739: Still some &#034;old MSft&#034; culture of battles between divisions and territorial behavior. Still not an awesome place to be supported as a senior female engineer, especially in terry myerson&#039;s org.</p> 
review740: - Teams were competing with each other, resulting in combative culture - Data and systems were not integrated, people spend lots of time on manual tasks which should be automated</p> 
review741: Big company politics affect how projects are funded in a negative way. Time pressures on projects were very heavy.</p> 
review742: Difficult/hostile work environment created by managers.</p> 
review743: Not so great Seattle weather</p> 
review744: Culture did not encourage cross group collaboration, especially around review times. From what I have seen in the last 3 years, a lot of things have changed</p> 
review745: Tight competition in the market and the need to make significant changes has adversely impacted the culture and opportunities that existed in the past.</p> 
review746: No collaborative work environment. Internal disputes and internal competition and lots of escalations turns simple things solving in more complex stuff and that deviate the focus from what really matters: the customer!</p> 
review747: I&#039;m a W-2 worker at Microsoft (via a staffing firm), and a U.S. citizen. My pay is $0 because I have yet to receive a paycheck three weeks after my start date. Imagine starting a job where: a. your pay rate is variable, even optional at the discretion of the employer ... even after you&#039;ve done the work. b. you don&#039;t know when your first paycheck will come, or even if your hours of work have been approved. c. The company doesn&#039;t think you&#039;re important enough to issue you a security badge on day 1. So, your start date (and pay) is delayed, and no assurances are given as to when that badge will be issued. Beg your new co-workers (or the intern) to let you in the office every day in the meantime. Observe that you are part of a scheme where your co-workers&#039; frustration increases because of your lack of badge. You&#039;re helping reaffirm company dysfunction. Be patient when people seem frustrated at you on some level for just being there. d. the position you just took was cut from 18 months down to four - even before you started. e. You&#039;ll also learn about all the jobs you applied for and passed over so Microsoft could give it to some H1-B worker (some of them management positions). If you can imagine that ... then you can imagine what it&#039;s like to start work at Microsoft. Details follow ... The only kind of work I was offered was a W-2 position with an employment agreement that says pay rate can change to any amount (or be eliminated) at the discretion of the employer. The recruiter said the position was 18 months. I later found out it was 4. More than two weeks after being hired and I still haven&#039;t gotten get my access badge for my building. Payroll setup hasn&#039;t been happening either. It&#039;s enough to make ANY person feel as though they are not valued at all. It&#039;s also a way for a company to tell an employee: &#034;You&#039;re welcome to work if you&#039;re willing to accept that your pay rate will be retroactively changeable at any time for any reason, or even eliminated. You&#039;ll have to beg your co-workers to get in the building for a few weeks, and we can&#039;t tell you when your first paycheck will arrive. We&#039;re hiring you because the talent in the H1-B pool just can&#039;t make the grade.&#034; If you take a job at Microsoft you can expect your live to start out that way. And if you&#039;re into that you&#039;ve debased yourself as a human on the outset. Microsoft management seems to understand that.</p> 
review748: its depends on the group your working in...</p> 
review748: Medical benefit is not good enough. No free food. No free healthy drinks. No personal office in some teams</p> 
review749: no work-life balance, red-tapes and politics</p> 
review750: Working in remote office in Silicon Valley can be a challenge, unless you are lucky enough to own a team that owns an important system.</p> 
review751: -making people managers who should not be managers!</p> 
review752: Politics and people that have been at Microsoft during the old Microsoft era are not easy to work with. New Microsoft is better but still discouraging to work hard and not get promoted because of politics and favoritism.</p> 
review753: Vision is fragmented across different products</p> 
review754: Nothing really. Just a good experience</p> 
review755: Review system makes things worse than if no bonuses were given at all. Morale can be crushed when someone is told &#034;you did good work, but it just didn&#039;t have enough visibility&#034;. Bonus system imbalance sees that certain people get large heaping bonuses, while other critical less &#039;sexy&#039; work is totally ignored.</p> 
review756: Our systems are just soooooo slow. It takes forever to make a decision. And many of our options are taken off the table by antiquated systems that are inflexible. We&#039;re working on that (which is good) but it is sooooo slow. While the culture is good (i.e., good work/life balance) I&#039;d say it errs to much on the side of life than work. But maybe I just like accomplishing things...</p> 
review757: long hours and a lot of hard work</p> 
review757: Not all teams are equally great</p> 
review758: Utilization for consultants is important yet outside of a consultant&#039;s control since it depends on whether there is an open position on a project. Too many reviews - 1 per quarter. Might have to travel weekly from one coast to the other if nothing available in your own region, but that is the nature of consulting, so not really a con.</p> 
review759: Difficult to maintain work-life balance. Like any large company, sometimes the politics can be frustrating.</p> 
review760: Too much middle management causes projects to move slowly.</p> 
review761: Management is not held accountable enough for end results, the products are not customer focused enough and waterfall is still a big part of development.</p> 
review762: Too many reorgs can screw up your growth</p> 
review763: Politics, inability to advance in certain roles/groups. Work/life balance still has a lot to be desired.</p> 
review764: Work-life balance is hard to achieve b/c of competitive</p> 
review765: Things are complex and change fast.</p> 
review766: Hard to grow (especially for people from the test discpline) with the latest flattening of orgs and the move of SDETs to SDE</p> 
review766: Maybe staring at a monitor takes a toll on the employees: They would shuffle up to the stations, one by one, decided which station they wanted food from, and at best muttered and pointed to the food they wanted to put in their mouths.</p> 
review767: layoffs every quarter, not competitive</p> 
review768: Combative culture. Limited ability to move functions and across the company. They don&#039;t value talent as much as they value experience to do the job you&#039;re being hired for.</p> 
review769: No real cons to share. I enjoy working here. The company is moving to make a change and it is for the better.</p> 
review770: People don&#039;t seem very friendly. They don&#039;t smile at you or acknowledge you when you walk by.</p> 
review771: Less challenging and may become boring after a while.</p> 
review772: Politics. Managers controls your career.</p> 
review773: Middle Management is still transitioning from old to new, however this is short term. beginning of 2016, it can be different.</p> 
review774: I sometimes felt frustrated because I was used to doing things to an A+++ standard and so found myself there often frustrated by more Lowest Common Denominator or C-level solutions. That was probably for me the hardest part about being there. It wasn&#039;t a cultural fit for me where I love efficiency, nimble-ness, best-idea-wins, and somewhat direct communication style.</p> 
review775: It has reduced the benefit significant and a lot of people are leaving and it just have hard time to retain people. No free meal.</p> 
review775: ultra competitive workplace with up or out mentality</p> 
review776: Management is not transparent. Review process better but still flawed. Lots of managers not connecting regularly and employees getting surprised at review time. Still some politics in senior management that lead to hectic changes.</p> 
review777: - Incentive structure encourages political fiefdoms</p> 
review778: &gt; Lower compensation compared to similar jobs in peer companies</p> 
review779: There are alot of guidelines to follow</p> 
review780: Not leading the industry and lot of of old timers have lot of politics going on.</p> 
review781: sales are going to college kids more and more. Not built for a sales executives</p> 
review782: None so far. Been here over 1-year already.</p> 
review783: Retail can have its typical problems</p> 
review784: It might be difficult to level up at some product departments.</p> 
review784: Big and complex orgs can make it difficult to navigate.</p> 
review785: Actual work is quite limited such that not much innovation / personal input can be stimulated</p> 
review786: life work balance, hard to get promoted</p> 
review787: Management is hit-or-miss. Some managers are invested in helping their directs succeed &amp; grow, but more and more, you&#039;re left to manage your own career. Content publishing is a dying breed. Editors have gone the way of the dinosaurs, and more and more writing is being shifted to vendors, with writers being reallocated to &#034;content analysts.&#034;</p> 
review788: Work gets thrown away, politics</p> 
review789: Poor work life balance to be competitive. Politics can be a problem at times as MS has grown to be quite large.</p> 
review790: More focus on timings and deadlines has to be there.</p> 
review791: Lower hourly pay than median average, tenured employees have more clout despite a lack of technical ability, arbitrary standards and operations, change happens at a snails pace. Still many confusing and draconian polices are left from the former CEO, some new polices still don&#039;t register with upper management and corp.</p> 
review792: Priorities shift on a regular basis, long work weeks</p> 
review793: Limited training to new hires.</p> 
review793: Despite the whole &#034;One Microsoft&#034; shift, there is still a lot of career based engineering going on in the culture. If you&#039;re a white male, you&#039;ll have to work your but off a lot more than any of the protected classes in the majority that will get promoted quickly or fast-tracked.</p> 
review794: Hard to meet utilization targets,high attrition,hard to gain knowledge due to shuffling and shifting of project roles based on demand</p> 
review795: Work life balance in MGSI</p> 
review796: - Feels like a &#034;has-been&#034; tech company - it&#039;s a large company and feels like it - If you&#039;re not in Redmond, you&#039;re a 2nd class citizen</p> 
review797: Despite recent advancements there are still opportunities to replace legacy ideas and systems.</p> 
review798: More focus on timings and deadlines has to be there.</p> 
review799: When the company reaches out to former dinosaurs to come back and lead, these &#034;leaders&#034; are from the era that Microsoft is trying to move away from, but instead of moving the company or business forward, they are all about themselves and their upward mobility. Before your hired, do your research on who your potential leader is going to be.</p> 
review800: Slow in getting things done</p> 
review801: No free food :( Some bureaucracy</p> 
review802: Hierarchy, slow reaction to the market,</p> 
review802: Work-life balance absent. Long hours, code bureaucracy (ownership). Based on Satya Nadella&#039;s new focus on cloud computing, embedded software focus diminished.</p> 
review803: To many processes in place for a company trying to become more agile.</p> 
review804: Mid level leadership often considers direct reports expendable. Still does annual reviews on a curve, just by another name. Few jobs have long term stability. Increased reliance on outsourcing. Bureaucracy slows down actual work.</p> 
review805: Lot of process and slow growth. Not the right place for college grads. Less opportunity to think outside the box.</p> 
review806: Success is highly dependent on the team / manager you have</p> 
review807: Politics Old way of thinking Difficult to adapt new technologies</p> 
review808: Sort of an odd ball within the core product team because you are not Program Manager, Developer, or Tester. Demotivating and unfair review system. Managers are trying to find faults of their directs because they are forced to find low rating employees at each review. Not much of an innovation compared to Google, Facebook, Amazon, etc.</p> 
review809: Work and life balance, excessive pressure</p> 
review810: Last Lay off rounds negatively impacted almost everyone.</p> 
review811: 401k matching is far from best in class Speed of executing projects can improve further</p> 
review811: Experience of Microsoft depends on the team you are in. It varies vastly.</p> 
review812: Change at a company this large takes time and lots of the old guard are still around. It will take time to complete the shift. If you aren&#039;t dedicated hours can seem long. If you work in tech this shouldn&#039;t be a surprise. If it&#039;s a problem find a new career.</p> 
review813: I am in a niche area - Operations. A COGS group, while the existing services understand that they need a support team to keep their product running, leadership often thinks that the product should be built in such a way that they do not need the cost of an Operations team. So while essential, it&#039;s a frowned upon area that seems to be hidden under the carpet quiet often.</p> 
review814: Management. The company is way too top-heavy. Engineers do not have enough freedom to do their jobs. The culture that came out of the 1-5 rating system is also pretty bad, where instead of working together people are trying to &#034;show off&#034; and look better than their peers. While I&#039;m sure this is a problem at any big company, it seems to be worse here do to the old review system culture that stuck even though that system was thrown out.</p> 
review815: Old CEO legacy culture and poor acquisitions</p> 
review816: Pressure to meet goals that are not always reasonable still exists, but for most roles goals are high but attainable. Microsoft has grown and now has way too many layers of management, most of whom are unnecessary and spend their time trying to appear relevant.</p> 
review817: Political and not collaborative peers</p> 
review818: Very large company, sometimes politics gets in the way</p> 
review819: Left when I had my first child due to work-life balance issues.</p> 
review820: Meetings run late and start late</p> 
review820: Review system is very unfair. Too much power given to managers. Lots of employees moving on b</p> 
review821: Low salary compared to industry peers, bureaucratic as the company has grown big</p> 
review822: Stack racking review made for a competitive instead of collaborative environment (stack ranking review system has been changed).</p> 
review823: Old managers in place, probably couldn&#039;t switch so hard to break into.</p> 
review824: The work happens a little slow</p> 
review825: Pressure to meet goals that are not always reasonable still exists, but for most roles goals are high but attainable. Microsoft has grown and now has way too many layers of management, most of whom are unnecessary and spend their time trying to appear relevant.</p> 
review826: Too many decision makers still in Finland</p> 
review827: Work life balance is extremely challenging. You are never truly offline. You do have the ability to set your own schedule, and that flexibility is appreciated.</p> 
review828: retail hours aren&#039;t the easiest</p> 
review829: Work/life balance is terrible. Although they try to provide programs to establish a good work/life balance, they instead cultivate a culture of &#034;life because of work&#034;. Programs encourage employees to have family time &#034;at&#034; work, or during &#034;fun&#034; work functions. Seriously unhealthy for both employees and for our community.</p> 
review829: Work/life balance is terrible. Although they try to provide programs to establish a good work/life balance, they instead cultivate a culture of &#034;life because of work&#034;. Programs encourage employees to have family time &#034;at&#034; work, or during &#034;fun&#034; work functions. Seriously unhealthy for both employees and for our community.</p> 
review830: Brutal, negative culture, poor managers, not a great place for women, hostile to creativity and innovation</p> 
review831: Tools are definitely not very good, build system, source control etc etc etc. But this is going to better soon I think</p> 
review832: Review system is still flawed. Bonus structure is no longer transparent. Health insurance is not what it used to be. At certain job level boundaries, it is easier to level externally than internally. If you&#039;re there for more than 3-5 years, you&#039;re doing something wrong.</p> 
review833: Bureaucracy, very slow, too many people who have worked there for too long wishing for the good ole days of Microsoft, smart people but not street smart.</p> 
review834: too much politics and process;</p> 
review835: Like any large company is heirarchical, longetevity in job matters more than merit, culture ia define by the GM your org is reporting into.</p> 
review836: long hours and low pay long hours</p> 
review837: low bar for hiring. most of the new hires are undergrads. very few master or phd grads. very small salary increase if you come in with a higher degree (master or phd).</p> 
review838: It&#039;s a large company, and an old company. It&#039;s already gone through the &#034;startup&#034; and &#034;young money&#034; phases, so you won&#039;t find much free food and it won&#039;t move as fast as you want it to. Also, it&#039;s a large company - a bug you introduce could impact hundreds of millions of people. Exciting, but stressful.</p> 
review838: Closed environment. Traffic in this particular location is a bit slow, but other than that a very fun job to work with.</p> 
review839: I must enter at least 5 words for Cons. But not really any cons.</p> 
review840: There are lot of exciting things happening, but they need to be advertised properly</p> 
review841: can be bureaucratic, less efficient than agile rivals, frequent reorganization and move (physical office move), performance review process can be optimized and doesn&#039;t always promote team work</p> 
review842: Slow path to seniority Company prefers to bring outside talent at higher levels instead of promoting internal talent</p> 
review843: Narrowing the market opportunity in the name of focus</p> 
review844: It&#039;s a big company, and so dealing with competing priorities could sometimes be a challenge. But this is expected for any company of size.</p> 
review845: There&#039;s always something that needs to be done so its important to define what Work Life Balance means to you and use those terms to honor</p> 
review846: Decision on overall direction take a long time.</p> 
review847: Below par, extremely high level of beauraucracy, high attrition.</p> 
review847: - Since it is a huge company with 90,000 employees around the world, your contributions at times may seem puny and irrelevant</p> 
review848: Have worked with some teams that seem absolutely cutthroat. Lots of politics involved, but that seems to be changing a little bit.</p> 
review849: Not agile enough to compete with other newly start up companies.</p> 
review850: Innovating at the speed of light has it&#039;s down sides</p> 
review851: It&#039;s a really large corporation and very often feels like that.</p> 
review852: 2 days of training was not sufficient to get to know all products.</p> 
review853: Very competitive, must excel at job. Due to the fact it&#039;s a large company efforts to make change are limited.</p> 
review854: You don&#039;t know what area you will work in when you accept the job offer. Depending on where you land, your work-life balance may be pretty bad. Little opportunities for learning and progress. Average compensation.</p> 
review855: None that I can think of</p> 
review856: Accept and move on before you are left behind.</p> 
review856: Not very competitive compensation. Too much management overhead. Broken review system.</p> 
review857: Previous test managers now manage devs in new combined engineering Rampant favoritism. You have to know right people. Those people have to know you.</p> 
review858: In the Senior bands and above, insanely unfair performance reviews. It all depends on how much the boss likes you. Seldom any relationship to value. There is plenty back-stabbing and tripping of fellow coworkers. If you are a woman, don&#039;t bother. There is a class action law suit pending, and it was filed for good reason. Even when you go for someone who likes you there are reorgs every few months and you end up working on something that you have no experience for, with no time to ramp up. I worked there 15 years, it is disgusting to see how differently bad the company is from when I started.</p> 
review859: can easily be lost in &#039;politics&#039;</p> 
review860: Lack of cross-group meetings, need to use windows (?)</p> 
review861: Some teams are not as effective as it can be.</p> 
review862: Chaos and a lack of checks and balances has become the norm in the attempt to become agile Teams have been cut too deeply and flattened so much it&#039;s becoming difficult to get things done Too data driven now - if you look only at data then companies like Facebook, Google or even the original Microsoft never would have been started</p> 
review863: Work can be challenging at times, but that&#039;s true wherever you go.</p> 
review864: The environment can get you become comfortable that could become a trap</p> 
review865: Lot of baggage from the past. Very centralized in Redmond.</p> 
review865: No longer viewed as leading edge, don&#039;t know what a lot of the company is doing.</p> 
review866: a little bit tense work experience which makes u work a lot with short notice</p> 
review867: - there&#039;s definitely a bit of a social hierarchy when it comes to being a contractor vs a full time employee. - there&#039;s an 18 month maximum on all contract work. After the 18 months, you can&#039;t apply for contract work with Microsoft for 6 months.</p> 
review868: very less scope to learn java, and open source technology</p> 
review869: Lots of politics and backstabbing. Rampant favoritism/racism and weak management at the lower levels.</p> 
review870: Variable quality of teams. Large organizations move very slowly. Total lack of agility. Over-staffed in some areas - people are there to make sure they&#039;ve got jobs, not to make new products. Work at principal level starts to become more about fixing the org, rather then interesting technical or product issues.</p> 
review871: Stack ranking is still here even though they no longer advertise it (there is no more bucket 1-5 or 20 70 10). Feel like company is lack of directions. Products/feature designs are not focused. Brand name is not very hot, they are turning around a little bit (but is it enough?) Senior management only cares about short term gain and lack of any kind of visions. CEO cares more about cost cutting than solving problem or innovating.</p> 
review872: Sometimes it&#039;s too big a company to make an impact.</p> 
review873: Sometimes it&#039;s a bit uncomfortable to work there because u have to stand for long periods of time so it&#039;s really tiring</p> 
review874: Hard to get visibility, lot of politics, difficult to get promoted if you don&#039;t talk louder than your coworkers. It&#039;s all about being seen and not about the work you&#039;ve done</p> 
review874: Growing pains as we leave behind the legacy</p> 
review875: The flip side of the coin I guess is that you are now needing to learn new ways (ironically ... that&#039;s actually how the rest of the industries have been doing things for a while) that is different from the Microsoft that most people use to know. If you are just looking for a nine to five job, you may find you have less and less room to go in Microsoft - there are still places for that, but far less common IMO.</p> 
review876: It&#039;s in constant re org and it&#039;s very confusing</p> 
review877: - Most HR and management have been in the company for 15+ years and are not adept at outside the box thinking. - Doesn’t feel like a tech company. Feels like Proctor and Gamble. Ironically, Microsoft once laughed at IBM for this structure - Overstaffed = office politics = creating pointless presentations and assignments for senior management that essentially add no value - Focus too much on end delivery to senior management. Should it really takes 1 to 2 weeks to generate a report? - Performance review extremely flawed and encourages backstabbing. Although this has changed, the management has not and this continues. - Coworkers subsequently not helpful, no transparency across teams</p> 
review878: I hope to see the company continue to embrace open-source technology</p> 
review879: You work really hard almost all the time, and there&#039;s a ton of politics involved in every decision.</p> 
review880: I did not like certain things. Specially, I did not like that sometimes you were unaware of the amount of time spent at work because they make it feel like you were at home.</p> 
review881: Need the right manager to get the most from the environment; must be able to deal with matrix and politics if your mid to senior management; some old school folks remain who need to drop the attitude.</p> 
review882: Subjective, Challenging, Lack of Vision</p> 
review883: Redmond completely disconnected from the field, with a seeming lack of urgency from leadership. Re-orgs every July at the new fiscal year. Never really settled on a strategy.</p> 
review883: In certain groups within the company, the culture can stifle creativity due to politics/processes, that are common at large corporations.</p> 
review884: Politics and very tight marketing budgets</p> 
review885: This has been a good experience. I don&#039;t really have any complaints that I want to voice at this time. Thumbs up here.</p> 
review886: technology innovations - missing new challenges in work</p> 
review887: Nothing that I know of...</p> 
review888: Company reputation turning around but still suffers a bit,.</p> 
review889: Lack of direction from management. Very political and bureaucratic.</p> 
review890: long term career growth and lateral/promotion moves within the company limited by management</p> 
review891: Review system is awful... employees even if they do a good job get screwed all the time</p> 
review892: To much politics, no loyalty shown to all the employee&#039;s by the business, very slow at change or adoption.</p> 
review892: Despite the progressive nature of the culture and all of the tools that make remote networking possible, Microsoft still suffers from the inefficiencies of having roles spread out across numerous locations worldwide. Lack of collaboration between orgs contributes to significant duplication of roles. Frequent issue of unnecessary rules for the sake of process delivery</p> 
review893: some times, it is too stressful because origination&#039;s changing too frequently</p> 
review894: Processes can be quite slow with such a large corporation with so many employees. It is a lumbering beast.</p> 
review895: Challenging, Management style, Processes, onboarding, trainings</p> 
review896: It does move slowly with change and it has allot of internal conflicts that end up impacting customers</p> 
review897: Bureacracy, corporate, expected to work above and beyond really depends on your direct manager/team I&#039;d say</p> 
review898: Everything is too &#034;Redmond, WA&#034; centric. So, if you are not willing to relocate, it may be hard to get the nicest, or higher visibility positions</p> 
review899: Too much middle management Too much politics</p> 
review900: Layoffs are getting out of control, especially in the field offices. Every summer they release a new &#034;blueprint&#034; of how many people each sub is aloud to have and what the org chart has to look like exactly. If someone in corp decides that job you are doing is not needed, everyone in each country that does that job is let go. Every year about 10% of my colleagues are let go and I had to let go my own direct reports. This month I got the notice that my role is not in the new blueprint and I have a few weeks to find a new job. I am working in a subsidiary office and I don&#039;t get any relocation assistance to return home. I even have to pay my own way to do interviews in Seattle to find my next job. (I can do the interviews over the phone, but that would put me at too much at a disadvantage.) HR does not provide any extra assistance to help me find a new job, I am totally on my own.</p> 
review901: To hierarchical and too many managers in the company</p>
