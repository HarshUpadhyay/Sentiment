review1: * It *is* becoming larger, and with it comes growing pains: bureaucracy, slow to respond to market threats, bloated teams, cross-divisional tension (though nothing remotely approaching that of Microsoft&#039;s internal tension). * The quality of the engineers is possibly dropping, but possibly not. It&#039;s hard to get real metrics, because as the absolute number of people grows, naturally the number of bad apples grows; as a percentage it&#039;s supposedly the same as it ever was, but with larger numbers of poorer quality engineers it just _feels_ like things might be changing for the worse. * Also with growth means more internal-confidential data leaks (again, because of the raw numbers of people) -- product announcements being ruined, etc. That means the company has to be tighter-lipped internally to avoid leaks, which makes things less open. It&#039;s still an amazingly open place, but less so than it was even a couple years ago. The good thing is they recognize  it and actively look to improve things because they know how important it is to keep the good culture.</p> review2: 1) Work/life balance. What balance? All those perks and benefits are an illusion. They keep you at work and they help you to be more productive. I&#039;ve never met anybody at Google who actually time off on weekends or on vacations. You may not hear management say, &#034;You have to work on weekends/vacations&#034; but, they set the culture by doing so - and it inevitably trickles down. I don&#039;t know if Google inadvertently hires the work-a-holics or if they create work-a-holics in us. Regardless, I have seen way too many of the following: marriages fall apart, colleagues choosing work and projects over family, colleagues getting physically sick and ill because of stress, colleagues crying while at work because of the stress, colleagues shooting out emails at midnight, 1am, 2am, 3am. It is absolutely ridiculous and something needs to change. 2) Poor management. I think the issue is that, a majority of people love Google because they get to work on interesting te chnical problems - and these are the people that see little value in learning how to develop emotional intelligence. Perhaps they enjoy technical problems because people are too &#034;difficult.&#034; People are promoted into management positions - not because they actually know how to lead/manage, but because they happen to be smart or because there is no other path to grow into. So there is a layer of intelligent individuals who are horrible managers and leaders. Yet, there is no value system to actually do anything about that because &#034;emotional intelligence&#034; or &#034;adaptive leadership&#034; are not taken seriously. 3) Jerks. Sure, there are a lot of brilliant people - but, sadly, there are also a lot of jerks (and, many times, they are one and the same). Years ago, that wasn&#039;t the case. I don&#039;t know if the pool of candidates is getting smaller, or maybe all the folks with great personalities cashed out and left, or maybe people are getting burned out  and it&#039;s wearing on their personality and patience. I&#039;ve heard stories of managers straight-up cussing out their employees and intimidating/scaring their employees into compliance. 4) It&#039;s a giant company now and, inevitably, it has become slower moving and is now layered with process and bureaucracy. So many political battles, empire building, territory grabbing. Google says, &#034;Don&#039;t be evil.&#034; But, that practice doesn&#039;t seem to be put into place when it comes to internal practices. :(</p> review3: I live in SF so the commute can take between 1.5 hours to 1.75 hours each way on the shuttle - sometimes 2 hours each way on a busy day or rainy day. That means being on the bus for 3-4 hours PER DAY. It&#039;s a wired bus though which means you can work on the way to Mountain View. But it can feel brutal. Your first year or two are really important in terms of your career at Google and they affect how you&#039;re viewed, and your ability to be promoted. You should always ask to work on high profile projects. If you don&#039;t get them, don&#039;t expect to get high ratings or get promoted. Always volunteer for cross functional group work for maximum exposure, and then work hard at those things. You&#039;ll likely work on something that no one will explain to you and it will take you at least a year to be comfortable doing what you&#039;re working on, even if you&#039;re super quick at learning. No one has time to train you or teach you what you&#039;re doing - which  is kind of hard. After two or three years, people you started out with at Google start to get promoted. If you&#039;re not one of them, you&#039;ll wonder why and how it happened, and that process is somewhat political and not always clear. It&#039;s a big company now. And super political. So don&#039;t be naive. Expect some people to be catty, some people to be territorial, and be prepared to be mentally tough. Don&#039;t let people see your vulnerableness. It&#039;s a Darwinistic culture with a huge dose of 30-something idealism on top which can fool you into thinking that people are easygoing - they&#039;re not. They&#039;re driven. If you&#039;re not driven, you&#039;re not going to fit in. When you start at Google, it seems like peer reviews are super important - they are, but they are the sprinkles on the fro yo. The important thing is that your direct manager knows your work, likes your work and likes you, and then you can get promoted. If your boss doesn&#039;t like  you, all the positive peer reviews in the world won&#039;t help you. Make sure you know what your boss wants, and give it to them. You will have weekly one on ones, and make sure you are addressing your performance at each one, asking if they have questions, how you can improve, can you work on cross functional projects, etc. It&#039;s really hard to find work life balance at Google. The workload is huge. I hardly have time to work out. The commute is brutal. My family sometimes needs more from me and I can&#039;t give it. I&#039;m still trying to find the balance. I think I need more down time than most people so I have a hard time being structured every day to fit all the things I want into my day, so a lot of things slip, like working out.</p> review4: Mountain View-centric attitude leads to extreme commute times. This is the largest negative about working here, and I probably would have left by now if I wasn&#039;t able to work from home or the SF office most of the week. I&#039;m sure if you live in boring suburbia it&#039;d be fine, but I don&#039;t want to do that.</p> review5: Things change so quickly that it can be difficult to figure out the right way to get something done.

Too many debates on the scope of the product.</p> review23: Constant change (depends on how you look at it, I see it as a positive) Becoming a &#034;big&#034; company</p> review24: -Navigating career changes internally can be challenging. Just because you&#039;re at the company doesn&#039;t mean the process is necessarily easier for changing roles -Can feel like a competitive environment at times but this is due to the fact that it&#039;s filled with high performing, over-achievers vs. actual competition</p> review25: It spoils you. If you ever leave, it would be very hard to work somewhere else.</p> review26: As the company grows, it takes longer to make decisions and get things done.</p> review27: Overall great experience, haven&#039;t found any.</p> review28: No cons that I can think of</p> review28: Way too much middle management and hierarchy, mostly incompetent lower level management (it&#039;s a quick way to get promoted when you&#039;re out of steam technically you start going to a bunch of meetings and become a TLM), little to no opportunity for advancement as individual contributor, super-competitive atmosphere, very little recognition is general, since your &#034;very best&#034; is &#034;meh&#034; there. Some people get promoted to very high positions for reasons unknown, others don&#039;t get promoted even though they very obviously deserve it (not talking about myself here). Lots of people are stuck doing crappy work they&#039;re way overqualified for, just waiting for a good opportunity to jump ship. Work life balance can be a challenge, especially if you want to get promoted beyond T5.</p> review29: Diversity of employee not close to home or lack of individual recognition.</p> review30: (1) Too many smart people, too much conflict. There is saying in Google, &#034;Welcome to Google, where impossible stuff is easy, and easy stuff is impossible&#034; (2) The company is now huge so we are seeing less and less collaboration between products.</p> review31: Internal politics sometimes prevents you from growth</p> review32: Some of the people are rude and don&#039;t listen to you so just make sure to select the right teammates in your groups.</p> review33: There is a lot of flux at the company (re-orgs on a regular basis), which makes it hard to keep your feet under you. Working at Google and excelling means either being really flexible and quick, or being inflexible and driving forward with your projects no matter the environment.</p> review34: Expensive area to live in</p> review35: Company has grown to be large</p> review36: Some of the challenges of working here are making sure that all the residents are taken care of and care for like they&#039;re supposed to be</p> review37: Big company, outside of your immediate team/department there isn&#039;t a strong sense of local community. It&#039;s hard to see impact importance of your work if you&#039;re in a large organization. Managers can be hit or miss. Decision-making / getting things done can be difficult in a large organization (bureaucracy or &#034;too many cooks in the kitchen&#034;).</p> review37: 1. Not too high salary 2. Technical interview is very difficult 3. No leetcode problems 4. New problems never saw before</p> review38: There was a growing number of employees that were simply &#034;resting and vesting&#034; so it became discouraging for those of us who wanted to make an impact. Felt like it was becoming more about MBAs who know nothing about marketing taking over and ideas were becoming less and less creative. People were less willing to take a risk.</p> review39: Long hours not so much fun projects occasionally disorganized structure at times long interview process</p> review40: Working for such a large company means it takes longer to get anything done. As an iOS developer, Google does iOS development very differently from other companies. Traffic is a pain getting in and out of campus.</p> review41: Job can be repetitive and boring. Nothing new to learn.</p> review42: annoying people hipsterish always wants to talk</p> review43: Incredibly competitive environment translates into always having to &#039;watch your back.&#039; Based on my experience, I would say the Engineer culture is very different from the Sales/Business culture. The Sales/Business culture can be stodgy, dry, and incredibly &#039;corporate.&#039; Training can be very difficult to find at times, which ultimately slows down ramp-up time.</p> review44: it was a lot of hard work, but thats expected</p> review45: Some real politics are going on these days. You will find the global business organization (their sales division) is more risk averse and people can be back-stabbing in your own team to get political gain. The performance review process is very flawed. They don&#039;t tell you what goes into it and therefore you may or may not get promoted and don&#039;t know why. Play the politics game and that will help you win. Make up inflated things around thought-leadership even if there is no sales component tied to it and you&#039;ll see you may get promoted.</p> review46: much brain wash, and more</p> review46: Hiring can be a mess and take forever. There&#039;s a lot of either deprecated technology in the stack or tech that is not ready to use.</p> review47: Still have politics. The company is large, so some things don&#039;t get done as quickly. Some overachievers are trying very hard to shine. If you are aggressive and try to climb the corporate ladder than the competition can be tough.</p> review48: Limited career opportunities given size of company.</p> review49: It is hard to get noticed. The imposter syndrome is strong. Promotions require extraordinary work. It really pastas to be self motivating, and self promoting. You need to get decent per reviews from your co workers</p> review50: last minute unplanned meetings can be a bit frustrating.</p> review51: Becoming a large corporation with the usual challenges</p> review52: Good not a lot if we are not the intended solely for a few months ago</p> review53: A need to improve muy english level , but i have the necessary level to work.</p> review54: none everything was exeptional i had a great time</p> review55: Company is becoming bigger so there is lot of competition for projects and promotions. Apart from that there is nothing else I can think of.</p> review55: All the frustrations of working in a large, flat organization: especially if you&#039;re trying to get anything done cross-functionally, takes awhile to figure out how &#034;the world works&#034; and deal with navigating the organizational structure. Where I was in the organization, pace and rapid change of projects could be challenging at times.</p> review56: The shuttle schedules were sometimes hard to work around</p> review57: Promotions are based on politics. For management &amp; HR: Many TLMs pick favorites and reduce opportunities for others by restricting project allocations. Encourage 6-month transfers to help employees find better and cohesive teams where they will happily remain and let others move. It&#039;ll also let bad teams / TLs get smaller and atrophy which is good for Google overall.</p> review58: not enough work, not worth it</p> review59: nothing really except you don&#039;t get to choose which state you&#039;d like to be placed in when you&#039;re entry level but a great company either way</p> review60: Frustrating management at times, hard to feel meanginful with so many people, tiring work sometimes.</p> review61: No room to become full time none contract.. Pay is on the low end.</p> review62: big company, need to learn skills to deal with it.</p> review63: very competitive and high stress</p> review64: Hard to go up as a contractor</p> review64: As it gets larger, it gets slower, more dysfunctional, less efficient.</p> review65: great workers and great food</p> review66: I can not think of anything</p> review67: Management quality depends on your department/product</p> review68: None at all. Can get difficult at times with middle management</p> review69: some times too much politics</p> review70: Long hours (55+) as an unpaid intern.</p> review71: Hires ex-consultants for operational leadership roles who continue to be consultants than operational leaders (with some exceptions). Not open to leveraging industry best practices and a lot of re-inventions happen for processes that can easily be leveraged from the market. This might be frustrating for folks with significant industry experience.</p> review72: no no cons, nothing negative</p> review73: Occasional long hours, high achieving culture with fast operations. On the sales/marketing side of the house, it&#039;s expected to be constantly connected to, and to have very fast TATs for asks, both client and internal.</p> review73: The pace is very fast, and it can be hard to achieve the right balance</p> review74: None the atmosphere is great wonderful work condition and great salery so working at Google is fantastic and very nice co workers</p> review75: Long time for a hiring decision for MBA full-time and intern roles.</p> review76: Do not have many opportunities to do something unique</p> review77: Middle managment at sales psitions tends to be mediocre. No attrition mechanisms. The company is willing to loose top performers instead of trying to keep them at Google.</p> review78: No direction, guidance or training. It was literally sink or swim. The content of what we were working on was not interesting or challenging and when tried to shift to other projects, we were told that we could only do this one thing. Usually a good manager will help their employees find a project where they can build their strengths. I think they didn&#039;t really care if we left, but thought, &#034;hey we can always hire more, we are Google&#034; - they treated employees as disposable. There was no flexibility for the team we were on, we were micromanaged and they didn&#039;t treat us like adults. Our manager was not interested in building our individual careers or supporting us, but just running the business at a strategic level and would constantly cancel meetings for personal reasons. Some people were obsessed about working at Google, almost like it was a sorority or fraternity and it was a little cultish. Even one of my friends said when I worked there, all I  did was talk about working there.</p> review79: Easy to coast, part of a large organism, can become institutionalized</p> review80: slow moving bureaucracy does not always react to change</p> review81: No downsides to me thinking of work for this company.</p> review82: core values don&#039;t always trickle down due to pockets of bad middle management.</p> review82: It can be daunting to start since you have to get used to all the tools (there are a lot of tools, especially Google specific tools).</p> review83: The company is becoming slower.</p> review84: Depending on the department, bureaucracy can quite a problem. There were obvious ways to make things better, but the top leaders were either uninvolved and focused on other &#039;sexier&#039; projects, or were never given the honest/critical information. Inefficiencies weren&#039;t fixed because teams and departments were built around how things worked (not optimally). This led to management pushing and trying to exceed targets in a non-optimal system, rather than trying to fix the system itself. Some employees were incentivized to get promotions by garnering attention, rather than improving and fixing real problems to improve the product and user&#039;s experience.</p> review85: Google is a blatantly liberal company.</p> review86: I cannot think of any.</p> review87: It&#039;s still a business, there are still offices... you&#039;ll never escape some aspects of a typical job</p> review88: the management was pretty bad, they didn&#039;t really listen to engineers and in particular treated engineering as if they were children</p> review89: Sales team is big and bureaucratic, not startup-like at all. Hard to get out of sales onto other teams. Very few opportunities in Boston due to it being a remote office.</p> review90: Bad career path. Most people stop at T5. To reach T6, you have to fight for leadership and ownership. Communication overhead due to the sheer size of the company. Personal growth. While you are exposed to interesting and technical deep projects, you are likely to get lost on how the entire infrastructure works. Bad if you want to build skills for running or joining startups.</p> review91: No Life - Work Balance, Not a Organizational Structure. Process is missing</p> review91: I never had problems there, salary was good not exceptional</p> review92: There are no other better companies in the world</p> review93: intern work may not be valuable to the company. fortunately mine was production</p> review94: It&#039;s a huge company. That means you won&#039;t always feel special like I have working at smaller startups. That also means that it&#039;s hard to generalize about the company. Life can be very different for you depending on your team and role.</p> review95: Management is hit and miss, there are lots of organizational restructures in the sales/marketing teams and it can feel chaotic, many of the pain points you&#039;d expect working for a big corporation</p> review96: Did not allow sleeping on the job</p> review97: Work culture, salary, benefits, trainings and poor communication.</p> review98: sometimes over time working. Normal salary</p> review99: It is easy to get lost and overwhelmed if you do not have a clear role and desire to continuously grow. If you get complacent or if you do not pay attention to surrounding teams, you probably will not be there long.</p> review100: Big Getting Slower Policy Parking</p> review100: no longer a flat structure, sometimes too hierarchical, HR too involved</p> review101: Google&#039;s hiring process is a bear, which made it very difficult as a recruiter. Making meaningful and non-trivial suggestions often fell on deaf ears.</p> review102: It was hard to balance my duties at work with time away from work in my personal life. I was constantly on and needed to put out fires</p> review103: Google has grown big and its hard to find your place.</p> review104: Lots of change constantly occuring</p> review105: Not a single thing I can think of</p> review106: Too many middle managers with lack of focus, start projects and then quickly abandon them, open discrimination of women, disabled and minorities.</p> review107: nothing bad to say about the company</p> review108: It may be some boring in Google recent years.</p> review109: hard to compete. Working env is turning like as it other big companies</p> review109: More and more problems when growing into a big company.</p> review110: Google is continuing to grow and as we do, it is increasingly bureaucratic... the quality of senior leaders is now uneven, and there is a level of uncertainty about the company&#039;s direction from senior executives.</p> review111: Too much delicious food, not enough time to eat it all. :)</p> review112: It &#039;s becoming larger, and with it comes growing pains</p> review113: Its gotten too big. Politics and bureacracy have become significant problems.</p> review114: The open office layout is noisy and distracting - it&#039;s possible to cope, but I really wish we had separate cubes or offices. Being social is required to get ahead. Everyone has a high level of competence coming in, so you get ahead through collaboration, leadership, impact, and other things that are difficult to do if you&#039;re not a social person.</p> review115: Constant restructuring, always had to &#034;prove&#034; self to new management, difficult review cycle (which improved slightly shortly after I left)</p> review116: There was always lots of work to be done and had to work long hours. Must be very committed to the job.</p> review117: So many talented people around you that it is very hard to single out.</p> review118: The &#034;brilliant people creating innovative things&#034; represents the engineering culture more than anything. In People ops, theres Google is full of corporate politics, as well as a changing culture. Google recruiting is now full of people who push buttons. People that have been then longer than 5 years still struggle to get a promotion or move into a new role. They shuffle the same leaders to different roles, making no room for growth. Moved recruiting like 5 miles away from main campus.</p> review118: If you want to be part of a small company where you can know everyone individually, Google is not the place for you.</p> review119: Long commute and turning into a very large organizaiton</p> review120: It&#039;s a large company, and like any big company, there can be bureaucracy. Commuting to Mountain View can be a bit of a drag.</p> review121: The sheer size of the company can be a bit aggravating sometimes. Along with the entitlement. Work-life was not particularly good at times.</p> review122: Competitive, because everyone you work with is also very talented.</p> review123: WLB in a lot of marketing teams is a myth</p> review124: complicated organization with frequent reorganizations</p> review125: You&#039;re a small fish in a big pond. Easy for some people to coast and get lost in the crowd. The work you are doing likely has very little impact on the overall company.</p> review126: Horrible place to work and management is completely removed from employees. I would not recommend working here.</p> review127: It&#039;s a big company, so you have to work harder to find opportunities to build new things. The nice thing is, the new things you build are built on top of the work of tons of brilliant people, so whatever you end up making will be very specialized and probably pretty awesome.</p> review127: large company, commute, spoiled me</p> review128: Poor work-life balance at work</p> review129: Nothing is bad about google</p> review130: Increasingly red tape gets in the way, and difficult to advance or change roles.</p> review131: Keeps getting bigger, and adopting thing that big companies use - like stricter budgets</p> review132: Duplicative efforts / often reinventing the wheel.</p> review133: Too far from the city, nothing to do in MTV. Hard to do extra projects as a contractor.</p> review134: Very little structure with a lot of moving parts.</p> review135: it has a lot of people working on a lot of projects so it&#039;s hard to make a decision</p> review136: If you want a fast-paced job, you need to work to find a team that works like that</p> review136: Can get lost in the organization if you&#039;re not careful, some products seem to lack focus.</p> review137: Incredibly diverse company hires and acquires way too many mediocre people, bad managers prevail.</p> review138: I think they need more programmers to make every part of Google useful</p> review139: The commute to Mountain View from San Francisco is horrific. Even if you work with people on the campus you may never see them due to sprawl and traffic.</p> review140: Since it is such a big company you can also get lost very easily. There are lots of custom proprietary tools that some people at Google only know how to use. And obviously that knowledge would be useless outside of Google. Understanding the interluding concepts is on the other hand useful.</p> review141: dangerous, zero growth, time away from home, no benefits</p> review142: Over qualified people could lead to lack of motivation at times</p> review143: Not easy to rise up.</p> review144: There are many overqualified and hardworking people here. Just hard work alone will not get you anywhere. You need to source for good projects, work hard and smart in order to have decent career advancement.</p> review145: I don&#039;t really have cons.</p> review145: The hands on model requires lots of work and is challenging to scale. Keeping all the students engaged and growing is a big responsiblity and requires constant vigilance.</p> review146: hard for a returning full time offer</p> review147: Too much work to do in a time</p> review148: Non-traditional sales roles that only use the complex AdWords platform</p> review149: None that I can think of.</p> review150: You can end up feeling like an extremely minuscule part of the company, because the company is so large. I was definitely lucky and got a team that was top-notch and extremely welcoming to interns, but others might not be so fortunate. While my team dynamic was great, some other interns had less ideal experiences. Being at this internship can definitely spoil you for other places.</p> review151: It does get boring sometimes doing the same thing over and over again and it takes a long time to get things done.</p> review152: Hard to get things done sometimes</p> review153: Workaholics, intense competition, constant game of thrones! Contractors are sort of a sub-class, make less money, have limited access to meetings, projects and facilities (for the same position).</p> review154: the pros are that it&#039;s not microsoft</p> review154: Employees are almost exclusively from top tier universities and privileged backgrounds. Relative lack of intellectual and cultural diversity.</p> review155: I saw a lot of hierarchical nonsense/ the promotion process seems to be very draining Horrible communication between the intern team and the interns (there are just too many interns to be perfectly honest)</p> review156: Workaholics, intense competition, constant game of thrones! Contractors are sort of a sub-class, make less money, have limited access to meetings, projects and facilities (for the same position).</p> review157: After Google changed to Alphabet they have been more difficult to reach for support. They have made numerous changes to the Google Trusted Photographer program which have affected my business. They required a heavy investment in specialized equipment and now are not offering sufficient support on trouble tickets. Don&#039;t become a Google Trusted Photographer if you are not a salesperson. It is a sales job, NOT a photography job.</p> review158: One is expected to deliver the best</p> review159: Can be bureaucratic at times due to the large size.</p> review160: Senior leadership basically full with old timers. One-size fits all process and lack of transparency for benefits, promotions, and salary can be frustrating. Cultures vary widely from team to team in terms of diversity/bias, expected work hours, or positive energy.</p> review161: - everyone is so smart, it&#039;s hard to stand out - expect high-level of efficiency/productivity - harder for low-level engineers to have high individual impact (you get impact by working on projects that have LOTS of users)</p> review162: Should work hard Oncall duties: many teams have engineers to respond to production outages.</p> review163: After recent restructuring it will be difficult for people in the Alphabet companies to move about between projects, which will limit future opportunities. The interview process makes it difficult for good people to come in, outside of being acquired.</p> review163: upper management doesn&#039;t take middle management seriously.</p> review164: Flat organization - leads to very autonomous environment. Products not geared toward large Gov enterprise.</p> review165: Public transportation is not very convenient</p> review166: Pay sucks and management is not very good with people.</p> review167: Extensive hiring process and long hours of work</p> review168: Commuting to Mt View on the bus</p> review169: No Opportunity to grow. Very data centric. Collaboration needs to be focused on.</p> review170: Can be very stressful at first and work/life balance can be difficult (depending on the team).</p> review171: Stress of the job can be high, especially if there is management turnover and frequent changes in priorities. Feeling like I have to compete with team mates.</p> review172: Busy busy busy very busy</p> review172: No Opportunity to grow. Very data centric. Collaboration needs to be focused on.</p> review173: Limited upward mobility in remote offices.</p> review174: Lots of competition for positions and slow up-ward mobility</p> review175: Many teams with uninteresting projects. Impact is limited.</p> review176: Google is obviously a large company so sometimes it&#039;s difficult to feel your individual work is making a difference in the larger scope.</p> review177: Nothing Not sure what else I can say To really express the fact that there are no Cons in working at Google</p> review178: Horrible systems Long work hours Demanding culture</p> review179: Felt I was always competing. More of a corporate atmosphere than I expected Always passing on work to higher ups, never really get to see the big picture.</p> review180: Gained 20lbs. Everyone is smart so not so easy to stand out. Headcount has not slowed for 5 years. Over crowded.</p> review181: - poor middle management in sales - people are doing things for the sake of doing something that sets them apart from others</p> review181: Long learning progress of infrastructure</p> review182: Nothing nothing nothing nothing nothing</p> review183: there were no cons ! great job!</p> review184: Google is very, very big. Because the size of the company is so vast it can sometimes be very difficult to get things done.</p> review185: A lot of the cons below are projections of my experience at Google. Do a TON of research on the role you&#039;ll be applying for. Find people on LinkedIn. Scour reddit. Learn as much as you possibly can about what you&#039;ll be doing to try and prepare for what&#039;s to come. * Your experience at Google will largely depend on your team and/or manager. If you join a bad team and/or a bad manager, you&#039;ll be in for a rough 12 months (the minimum amount of time that&#039;s usually required to transfer out.) * ANYTHING you do or create outside of work is owned by Google, regardless of whether you used their resources or not to do it. This could be a HUGE issue for you if you contribute heavily to open-source and/or like to build side projects. Google&#039;s People Ops **do** look out for people doing this too. * The compensation is okay depending on where you&#039;re coming from, but salary is practically non-negotiable (stock units are more flexible, though) and  might not even be competitive depending on your area. Lots of funded startups and finance shops pay significantly better for the same level of experience. Additionally, compensation doesn&#039;t scale relative to growth. One could double their salary or more within the same amount of time it takes to get from mid-range to senior at Google. * Almost everything that an engineer at Google uses on a daily basis is home-grown and maintained by other Googlers. Much of this tooling is incredibly complicated and takes months to warm up to. This could be a MAJOR brain drain to consider depending on your career path and/or whether you&#039;re thinking of staying at Google long-term. (That said, some of the tools were pretty good, though I usually preferred third-party alternatives for many of the others I worked with.) * Most of the sexy projects that makes Google Google are in Mountain View, and if you really want to take your career at Google seriously, you&#039;ll eventually have  to move out there. Living costs in the Bay are insane and show no signs of restoring sanity any time soon. * Despite having all of the infrastructure to support it, remotely working is generally discouraged by most teams. That said, many, MANY meetings are done completely or partially with Hangouts and Google&#039;s solution for accessing internal resources from public endpoints is probably the best there is. * Their interview process is generally terrible. Engineers at Google generally don&#039;t like to interview and/or provide feedback, so the interview experience for potential candidates varies wildly across the board. The process also takes a really long time. It took me about four months to get to the offer stage; apparently, that&#039;s normal there. (To put this into perspective, I&#039;ve worked at places that took a week from cold start to signed offer; they can&#039;t possibly not be losing talent from these insane delays.) * I don&#039;t remember seeing more peop le glued to their phone or laptop in a single workplace before coming here. It seems like almost everyone travels while glued to their phone here. It&#039;s maddening. * Most interviews are focused almost entirely on technical merit. This makes it (much) more likely for engineers with strong technical skills but (very) weak social skills to make it through the cracks. If you&#039;re more outgoing and &#034;extroverted,&#034; this might bother you. (It bothered me to no end.) * There&#039;s lots of exciting work being done at Google, but more exciting work usually means even more operational work. A lot of extremely capable people get slotted into doing that sort of work. Do as much research as you can on your role to give you an idea of what you&#039;re getting into. * Technical merit is placed above all else as an engineer. Because this is a significant determinant in promotion decisions, a lot of people spend a lot of time doing &#034;complex and impactful&#034; work at th e expense of things like documentation or maintainability. As you might imagine, this leads to a lot of reinvented wheels and deprecation. (It doesn&#039;t help that every project seemingly *has* to have a name to it that might or might not have anything to do with the project that describes it.) * Work-life balance HIGHLY depends on your team. In my experience, people at Google that spent a lot of time working after-hours did so on their own volition (for better or worse). Management never pressured me to work more than I wanted to; in fact, they&#039;ve had to tell people to ease up!</p> review186: Internal code base is huge, it takes long time to get familiar with it. Promotion system is a bit flaky and is not refocused on impact rather than quality</p> review187: There are not that many women working at Google or in leadership positions there. This negatively affects the team dynamics, for both men and women. Women reading this - apply! Aim high! You can do it!</p> review188: The company would like you to drink the Kool-Aid. I did in the beginning, and became disappointed by a lot of things. Now I look at Google as a big company that is doing it&#039;s best, and I do my best. I&#039;m much happier now.</p> review189: Takes a while to get things done because of the size of the company you need to make sure noone else is working on what you&#039;re working on, and even if they are you can still do it anyway if you think you&#039;re better at politics.</p> review190: Google is now a bloated, political organization. Unless you are a software engineer you will learn more elsewhere, and have greater upside at a Facebook or a start-up. HQs are in MTV, outside of there your career stagnates.</p> review190: The organization is very flat with lots of Type A personalities meaning that its pretty cut throat to move up.</p> review191: Lack of people development Short term focus (OKRs) Questionable leadership</p> review192: None. Google was an amazing place to work!</p> review193: - Work-life balance can vary significantly depending on what team you work on. Processes can be overly bureaucratic at times. The promotions process can be pretty opaque.</p> review194: You are not always part of those projects and initiatives. Becoming more corporate: less about what you can actually do and skills and more about politics and who you know.</p> review195: It is become bigger and layered. Most of the time you don&#039;t know which part you are working on within the huge system.</p> review196: politics, process now means that the company moves more slowly that before</p> review197: no option to work from remote office</p> review198: - Getting big - Competitors might be nimbler. - Talented colleagues also make it harder to get promoted</p> review199: Not many experienced hardware engineers from the industry</p> review199: No need to change a thing, and stay the same.</p> review200: Some internal group (eg. corp-eng) has management that&#039;s not on par with the rest of the company.</p> review201: I think there are no cons here, unless I lied. And I don&#039;t wanna do that</p> review202: So many politics, promotions based on popularity not aptitude.</p> review203: I don&#039;t really have any cons! Maybe the only con was that the food is too good and too plentiful so I gained about 7 lbs during my internship :(</p> review204: very exhausted, less benefits ... etc</p> review205: I enjoyed my work but didn&#039;t feel like what I was doing was terribly important. I was also working on one of Google&#039;s smaller campuses, and there was no intern community there.</p> review206: 1) Inexperienced and bloated middle management. 2) The white badge vs red badge situation creates conflict within departments. In this employment model, an employee sits next to a contractor, both do the exact same work but the employee gets paid 2x as much and has a full benefits packages.</p> review207: A lot of tedious work and some off the people are not so great</p> review208: I struggled with finding ways to progress my career and change verticals.</p> review208: Sometimes too big and complicated to navigate, very inwardly focused</p> review209: Opportunity for vertical movement is scarce. Hiring practices have led to hiring candidates based on who has the best resume, rather than who is the best person for the job. Culture of ladder climbing slows down productivity and leads to a lot of people being stepped on.</p> review210: Terrible place to commute to if you want to live in San Francisco Easy to feel like a small cog in a big machine Limited upward mobility at this point</p> review211: Nothing was really wrong. It was great.</p> review212: Google is now a large company so there&#039;s a fair amount of bureaucracy and processes in place which can slow things down. Promotions are harder to come by but this is natural for any company of this size. Google is heavily email-centric and so you better be ready for 200+ emails a day and sometimes an implicit expectation to be on email during off-hours.</p> review213: Need better communication between engineering and other departments/teams</p> review214: I would say that the only thing I can say would be a Con working for Google would be if you didn&#039;t work for them anymore.</p> review215: Mountain View centric. If you are remote, then your opinion is much less important. Some of the departments are very hierarchical.</p> review216: - Commute: 1.5 hours is alleviated by riding on the shuttle, but it is still 1.5 hrs. - Overcrowding: Open-office is somewhat distracting</p> review217: pressure from managers, strict deadlines, no life for social</p> review217: hours varied, upper management can be tricky</p> review218: Like any organization, there are internal politics that need to be navigated. Some play this well, some don&#039;t. Making sure you align yourself on the right person&#039;s good side can be tricky.</p> review219: Nothing really. You need to compete very hard as everyone seems to be brilliant!!</p> review220: Pretty competitive, lack of opportunities for full-time as a contractor</p> review221: You usually work on technically fairly small things because it&#039;s a giant company with a lot of resources.</p> review222: Work could be stressful in some groups. I sometimes heard coworkers in some other groups talking about working overtime to get assignment done.</p> review223: Not really any cons about working here</p> review224: the privacy agreements. engineering sector is dominated by asians who tend to ignore people outside their race.</p> review225: the politics, the pressure, the stress, the backstabbing, cutthroat colleagues, the lack of transparency, constant reorgs, lack of job security, the disposability of employees, lies from management. Human Resources team is a ship of fools.</p> review226: None that I can think off. Well, maybe a long commute from the city.</p> review226: Has gained a bit of bureaucracy around actually shipping software, but not too bad, and most of it is intended to prevent wild, west coding.</p> review227: Big company with big company red tape, many regulations about when/how you can get a promotion or move around, experience if very dependent on your manager</p> review228: too much work, lot of pressure</p> review229: Salary is fair. Work is not challenging enough. Experiences vary in different teams. Some teams are good while some teams are not. My manager isn&#039;t nice to me. He didn&#039;t trust me and didn&#039;t give me fair reviews. He didn&#039;t give me enough help either in my work or in my career development. I won&#039;t recommend my team to any of my friend.</p> review230: It is highly competitive, with many very smart engineers.</p> review231: too many people, imposter-syndrome inducing, no symmetry is prohect complexity among interns on different teams, it&#039;s Google!</p> review232: HUGE bureaucracy, with a company this big there is specialized roles and process for everything. Definitely not an &#034;intimate&#034; community and can take forever to get approvals for what seems the smallest thing.</p> review233: Management can sometimes get in the way of you doing things.</p> review234: Too large company, and you have to learn quickly</p> review235: There are a lot of people working at Google, so the quality of your colleagues really varies.</p> review235: Some of the work can be rather mundane, it is an advertising company at the core</p> review236: No cons come to mind</p> review237: some projects are more advanced than i&#039;d like. however, i still love the expereience at google</p> review238: Constant travel, devices shut down sometimes</p> review239: Competition is fierce among peers. Middle-management is hit-or-miss. The pace is grueling and relentless.</p> review240: Given the size, it&#039;s challenging to move up in role and sometimes hard to feel your direct impact on the business.</p> review241: very good company to join</p> review242: Turned into a big company</p> review243: work life balance is not good</p> review244: Everyone is so busy that it is hard to connect or make friends at work</p> review244: The work is tough and you&#039;re surrounded by people that are smarter than you, it can be overwhelming but it really brings out the best in you</p> review245: Peer review makes you think why others are smiling at you all the time.</p> review246: Your experience may vary depending on team, manager etc. If you are passive about your career growth, it may not match the trajectory you hope for While better at it than most, its simply a very large company with the accompanying bureacracies</p> review247: You do not get your own office. When you work it is mostly an open floor plan.</p> review248: More diversity would be nice</p> review249: Big company. Political. A lot of red tape</p> review250: There are no major complaints.</p> review251: tedious work, do the dame work everyday. Do not feel important in this company, the company runs the same way, with or without me.</p> review252: As a contractor, there is a pretty clear hierarchical thing working there. Some conferences and info are limited, and no freedom to do what you want.</p> review253: Hard to move inside the org, very political and given its huge size it is much harder to grow in this company than elsewhere. Salaries might be amazing or terrible, and it all depends on the country, its taxes and your level in the company unfortunately, not the job.</p> review253: Little autonomy to get stuff done, difficult to get promotion, Henry Ford model of repetition being deployed all over</p> review254: I haven&#039;t yet seen any so far, especially in my roles.</p> review255: All the workplace benefits are needed when you spend 10+ hours a day at the office frequently</p> review256: The work can be somewhat monotonous and transactional depending on your specialization</p> review257: Long travel, long hours, everything you would expect</p> review258: Too crowded in the MTV headquarters</p> review259: intern program could be better organzied for the SMB teams</p> review260: Contractors do feel not as welcomed</p> review261: -it&#039;s already big so it&#039;s difficult to contribute a large amount as a lower level person -vacation days took a step back for the first few years - afterwards it&#039;s better.</p> review262: has become very political/career growth is much slower/comp is not great</p> review262: sometimes people come to google and think they&#039;re better than everyone else and that&#039;s not the spirit of google. sometimes people get self entitled and it stinks</p> review263: The place smell like mold, the pay isn&#039;t enough, they tell you that your full-time and only put you on the schedule 1 or 2 days a week. The management sucks and their very unorganized.</p> review264: Slow growth in terms of promotions.</p> review265: Could become a little bit political around promotion as most big companies. Job mobility can be attained around Mountainview but would be harder in other regions.</p> review266: Was not working on a project I particularly liked, and I saw that it can be difficult to move around in the company</p> review267: Large company, inherent bureaucracy, takes a lot of effort for changes to happen quickly.</p> review268: Conducting a lot of events on campus</p> review269: Managers Should give more feedback to temps.</p> review270: Changing the way things are done takes hard work and lots of time. Burnout is common but not a sign of weakness.</p> review271: For this job I don&#039;t think there are any cons.</p> review271: There are limited teams in the NY office</p> review272: Upper management tends to micromanage and they keep adding responsibilities to job expectations. Proper training is generally not provided.</p> review273: Your happiness depend a lot on your team dynamic and manager some managers can be very pushy or bring bad work culture from their previous employment.</p> review274: I second the person who said Google protects bad managers. It seems like the more talented people leave and the less talented people get promoted (it&#039;s more about politics than talent). The company gives lip service to users and UX but you only have to use their products to see how little they care about getting it right. They say &#034;put the user first&#034; but the people who succeed are the ones who know how to game the broken reward system and check off the right boxes while shipping a broken product. PM&#039;s have all the power and UX has no backbone, because people are too worried about their next peer review. People don&#039;t take pride in their work, because you are rewarded for launching, not doing a good job. Mentorship exists in name only - you won&#039;t learn or grow here, unless you want to learn how to design by committee, take shortcuts and ship crappy products.</p> review275: Working in Mountain View. Living nearby is undesirable, but living someplace desirable means a 90+ minute commute.</p> review276: There wasnt really any cons that I can talk about It was overall a great experience and im glad I got to be apart of it.</p> review277: Not enough pay, but I could get better at marketing.</p> review278: The sales org is huge. You can easily project your career growth, or lack there of. Very easy to look at your role today and map out the 24-36 month promotion cycle, with minimal fluctuation. Every year or so, some new person in upper management comes in wanting to make a name for themselves and re-orgs, which is a fancy way to say they just shuffle the deck, everyone is confused for a month or so, then people just go back to doing their jobs.</p> review279: lack of leadership direction, Lazslo&#039;s book is great reading but not all the concepts are really fully practiced at Google</p> review280: There are not any cons</p> review280: I have no cons to add</p> review281: Don&#039;t expect lots of hand-holding from management and team leader.</p> review282: Career evolution can be non-existant, so much depends on how good your manager is.</p> review283: Its a big company so its sometimes slow and sometimes very fast paced which can be time consuming</p> review284: working hard, too much work sometimes</p> review285: overall Google&#039;s focus is on defending their cash cow; their other activities almost seem like they&#039;re just trying to keep talent off the market and away from competitors. that means if you&#039;re an engineer, you&#039;ll have a great time. but if you&#039;re a product-oriented person, caring about market success, customer satisfaction, etc, you&#039;ll get frustrated after a few years. top management is very split in it&#039;s priorities, there are generally a lot of chefs involved in any decision making, and the decisions tend to be reversed or altered fairly quickly. a surprisingly large percentage of the senior talent do not view Google as a long-term career path, which leads them to focus on a couple of promotion phases and then they&#039;re off somewhere else.</p> review286: Company is getting big and lost some of the original culture.</p> review287: There really aren&#039;t too many downsides. Maybe one would be that everyone else there is also smart and it is hard to really stand out as being great.</p> review288: Relationship driven environment which some times hurt people who are result oriented and doesn&#039;t like to gossiping around. I have seen when top performer let go.</p> review289: Poor chances for promotion, Lilmited propsect to work on interesting projects. The downside is that you might risk getting yourself pegged as a generalist or a Jack-of-all-trades.</p> review289: They&#039;ve grown. As a SysAdmin your relevance to companies outside of Google will decrease with time as you begin to work within proprietary systems. All of the things that Google never wanted to be... they have become: A corporate giant that has lost its way of managing the employees; also see &#034;Corporate Politics 101.&#034;</p> review290: Awful bureaucracy, poor management support.</p> review291: Not much to do here</p> review292: Preventative-only health insurance for contractors, which is effectively no insurance at all. I had to buy my own.</p> review293: There should be more room for contractors to convert, especially if they have shown exceptional performance.</p> review294: High cost of living (Mountain View, CA) Mundane work, not everyone is working on an exciting project</p> review295: The actual work... it will probably suck. Don&#039;t be fooled. You will probably get told very little about your role before you start. Then you will spend a lot of time ramping up in your job, drinking from a hose, and one Sunday evening discover that the fit is bad and dread Monday morning. All you can do is suck it up, smile, find the good in your job or try to find a new role. Good luck with finding a new job in Google... During the day you will see people use the ping pong tables or eat in the cafeteria having a great time and wonder why you never have time to do that as you eat at your desk. If you want to work on and launch Awesome Widget X 1.0, you will have lots of red tape, meetings, and presentations to give to different levels of higher-ups and peers. You will do actual project work at home. You will spend your day in meetings. Perf. Just believe me when I tell you that you will hate it. It&#039;s annoying. OKRs. Necessary, but really annoying. Imagine  having to score your quarterly goals, 1.5 months into the quarter. You still have 1.5 quarters left, but management wants to have their scores ready, so they can hand them into their directors who need them 1 month before the quarter ends, so they can give them to their VPs 3 weeks before the quarter ends, etc... Delivering on commitments is important, but this OKR process is a joke. Salaries are low, but the stock compensation helps offset it a little. It makes budgeting hard when you depend on stock to pay rent for your cardboard box apartment in Fremont. Compensation can be very generous, but ymmv. Google pays for performance! If you are a rockstar, you will be well paid. Well paid! Larry will make it rain! However, if you are merely really good, you will be underpaid. Are you a rockstar or just really good? 20% time really exists, just be sure to add it to your 100% time. Having people outside of Google light up and ask you if working there is like the Internship Movie.  They get sad and disappointed when you say &#039;no&#039;.</p> review296: over rated, boring, hierarchical, political</p> review297: There are not many Cons in this business so thanks everyone</p> review298: Commute is tough, if you don&#039;t like shuttles.</p> review298: promotion is much slower and harder than other places.</p> review299: I can&#039;t think of any con of Google. If you have the chance, please come to Google.</p> review300: Nothing bad, free food and nice working culture</p> review301: Large corporation, so it has typical big company problems- hard to have career growth, promotions are difficult to get, decent amount of bureaucracy, you are one among many people, etc.</p> review302: The office space is outdated. Could use new radio equipment.</p> review303: Big company (it can be hard to feel you are making a difference for the company).</p> review304: Work life balance can be an issue.</p> review305: It takes time to get promoted and there are always tons of emails to check!</p> review306: It&#039;s big... really big Sometimes too decentralized</p> review307: I can not think of any. you can do anything you wish as long as you get your job done. nobody looking over you making you nervous</p> review307: - rat race - &#034;nerd culture&#034; - arrogance</p> review308: bureaucratic, you constantly have to go above &amp; beyond what is expected of you on your ladder or else you can&#039;t get promoted.</p> review309: Sometimes loaded with work and extra hours will be required. You must not get behind or you will definitely have to put in extra hours.</p> review310: The company goes through very frequent changes. Some positions in the company are impacted more negatively by these changes. But that isn&#039;t a shortcoming of the company as a whole, but rather just a few select senior management. Luckily, we have an avenue with which we can voice our discontent with the senior management. And last round, the discontent was shown to be abundantly clear.</p> review311: Google definitely has a big company feel and at first can be extremely overwhelming.</p> review312: Long hours of work, often find myself bringing home work, to finish it. Its fine, if you love to coding, and bring it home and do it often there too.</p> review313: Hectic Schedule for the bay area</p> review314: The management takes credit for a lot of the work the lower level employees do. A lot of unreasonable deadlines.</p> review315: The commute from San Francisco sucks, but the alternative is to live in the south bay which also sucks, and either way rents are terrible.</p> review316: There are no cons as of today. So many things to be grateful for!!</p> review316: Intern community not as strong in remote offices. Can get stuck working on boring projects Time to get ramped up on systems unique to Google is large. Real work is not expected for full time employees for a few months.</p> review317: Moving up the ladder can be much slower than it should be, tendency to value long term goals leads to a fair amount of technical debt that isn&#039;t rewarded when payed off</p> review318: Lots of type A people. At times you can run into cliques and things can become political. That&#039;s probably true of all large organizations.</p> review319: None really. Great place to work. Great people, great benefits, pleasant upbeat atmosphere, and I highly recommend any one apply here</p> review320: sudden budget-cut outcomes that you face without any prior notification</p> review321: nothing about cons so far.</p> review322: - I have never seen a normal and smart Manager : their all have their limits or issues - sometimes you will work your really hard and nobody will care and you will have no return on your professional investment - promotion process is a real joke (the peer review process is NOT the one that matters actually) - somewhat lower quality people (compared to before) : the new recruits are in general less smart - food is definitively going down big time (but this is still free so you cannot complain too much, right?) - perks going down (there were better before)</p> review323: After a point, figuring out how to advance is difficult at best.</p> review324: 1. Company is too huge hence it can be difficult to get a chance to work on large projects.</p> review325: The hours were super long and stressful. The work was super duper hard and sometimes i couldn&#039;t handle it. I would be prepared to bust your butt if u work for google because it&#039;s a big company.</p> review325: too big. lots of politics. all the decisions get made in california and not in satellite offices</p> review326: Stressful, intense, and frustrating at times</p> review327: Preferencias de sitios para citas en interner</p> review328: You work this is not a 9-5 job with weekends off. I read the reviews of everyone on here and they cry about having to work on weekends cause Google hints about it but does not enforce it or you have to get in good with your direct supervisor, divorces, quality of life, people crying,cockiness in the work place promotes competitiveness which in turn brings results......toughen up people did you think you were going to be making a six figure salary and not work for it? Yes you work but it balances out perks and a company that is going to be around in the years to come. Like the saying goes if you can do better go else where. Everyone has gotten way to spoiled and soft. People need to look around and see what other jobs people are working and look at yours then be grateful there&#039;s a hell of a lot worse.</p> review329: Slow in decision making. Sometimes too slow to react to market trends.</p> review330: honestly, nothing everything was amazing!</p> review331: Managers, teams, projects are often reorganized, and you can switch from a great situation to a very bad one overnight.</p> review332: The demands get ever stronger by the day. With all of the onsite perks, one is expected to stay longer hours. Work-life balance is an afterthought. And since the company is so large, it&#039;s difficult to foster synergy within the same department, let alone between different departments.</p> review333: Not apple. I deserve 220k and who the hell thinks that this company is the best? It isn&#039;t! Have fun with your 500 dollar bonus. i&#039;m going to investment banking!</p> review334: Team could be a little more organized</p> review334: If a person is hired on at a junior level, HR expects that person to earn promotions until they attain a senior level. Google management winnows out those who don&#039;t earn a senior level within a certain amount of time. That said, Google management does not require anyone starting out at a senior level to earn promotions.</p> review335: So large its hard to get recognition for hard work sometimes</p> review336: No office privacy. Gossip. Poor work-life balance, unless you remain on campus. Work from home discouraged. Performance management too frequent and subjective.</p> review337: All the pros I listed can make you spend too much time at google and ruin your work/life balance.</p> review338: - lack of structure may be an issue in certain orgs/teams</p> review339: hope I can have longer time internship in Google</p> review340: not too many downsides upward mobility is hard though</p> review341: It&#039;s hard to get promotion. It&#039;s a big company. If you want to be seen, you should try really hard.</p> review342: Very demanding but you should expect that from any major company that is changing the world.</p> review343: ............So yeah no cons at all really</p> review343: Small part of a large company</p> review344: Not being treated as an equal employee when contractors contribute same if not more than regular full time employees. Very discouraging.</p> review345: 1. The food quality is decreasing 2. Some talented people are seeking their career in startups 3. Cannot make as big impact as in startups</p> review346: Few bad managers to deal with</p> review347: Coworkers talk too much about how much they like Google.</p> review348: There is almost no room to move around and the contract I am under does not have a good conversion rate.</p> review349: Just too big for me now. I&#039;m sure it&#039;s right for some people, but for me it&#039;s just a major company now and not the type of thing I&#039;m looking for.</p> review350: Google is the ogrelord of companies</p> review351: similar to all big corporations, google is a good place for you if you are comfortable to do your day to day job and get paid. if you still have a dream to make a mark of your own, this is not the place for you.</p> review352: The company is too big therefore some things are slow</p> review352: We are allowed to use google products only here.</p> review353: Expensive place to live. Salary is good but trying to buy a house out here is brutal.</p> review354: Things are getting bloated in middle management, which makes it harder to make an impact as a newcomer. Promotions also take longer than before.</p> review355: The commute, and the sheer size</p> review356: None really, but i guess they could work on the hours.</p> review357: too many lines of code.</p> review358: Large company with lots of bureaucracy, rigid rules when it comes to promotions/pay increases</p> review359: Time blurs between work and life must be a go getter, not a quitter</p> review360: Reorgs -- Can get rearranged and moved around.</p> review361: - slow development cycle as incredibly inter dependent on a lot of teams and people. - projects can succumb to normal pitfalls of a big company.</p> review361: Yes, Google is amazing but not all roles at Google are amazing. The work is largely reactive for many roles and sometimes you feel like you are fighting for table scraps when it comes to new and exciting work simply because you&#039;re surrounded by tons of high-performing, over-achieving (but wonderful) individuals.</p> review362: You can burn out if you&#039;re an overachiever, getting &#034;fruitier&#034; every week</p> review363: Better work life balance needed</p> review364: For interns converting to full time, it&#039;s annoying that you have to sign an offer before getting matched with a team</p> review365: There are no major cons to speak of</p> review366: Google is probably the best large company to work for, but it&#039;s still a large company. But, every year the leadership is a little more removed from the reality of low- and mid-level engineers and it shows in tone and decision-making.</p> review367: The motivations and aspirations of upper management are opaque.</p> review368: Big company issues (bureaucracy, etc.) Lack of growth / promo opps Some lack of vision / execution at the top Travel to office</p> review369: Team is so big that you cannot feel your own contributions.</p> review370: - Various levels of talent in the broader organization. Although some of the employees are inspirational, e.g., Senior Engineering Directors and Strategy leads who are seasoned, brilliant leaders from McKinsey, Goldman, etc - the majority of the workforce is comprised of apathetic, lazy technical and sales staff who just need the paycheck to cover their jumbo Bay Area mortgage - Career development and skillset training is a bit limited compared to other fast-paced work environments</p> review370: You actually were 1/50000 employees and GSX employees receive none of the &#034;google campus&#034; benefits.</p> review371: I do not like the lunch room lol but it is cool</p> review372: I can&#039;t think on any downsides as I really enjoyed my time there.</p> review373: I can&#039;t really think of much. It is true that the coolest jobs are in CA, so if you&#039;re in another office the opportunities can be limiting.</p> review374: speed can be improved. This SV, we need move faster</p> review375: Despite what&#039;s official, the work expected of you and thus the hours that go into the job are ridiculous and not one that you can expect any sane company to expect.</p> review376: Not much I can say about cons. I do sometimes with a bit more visibility from upper management was present. But all in all its a great place to work with bright and motivated individuals.</p> review377: Having time to take of myself physically, and taking the the time to eat properly.</p> review378: A tight work schedule with many all nighter</p> review379: It is in Buenos Aires. This job is available all over the world and the pay in other places is way better.</p> review379: Salary structure is below market level</p> review380: Calls customers and sales and software</p> review381: Nothing to complain about.</p> review382: Haven&#039;t found any so far!</p> review383: not very inspiring big company feel lots of hierarchy</p> review384: Google has no cons at all</p> review385: Some jobs don&#039;t last very long. You might make good money at one job and the next one not so good. Depends on the job and the company you work at.</p> review386: They don&#039;t let us play in Treehouses that often :/</p> review387: It&#039;s a large company, so you can expect to work on a relatively narrow problem. While office politics isn&#039;t bad, it does occasionally frustrate, with projects getting moved around without consultation of rank-and-file employees.</p> review388: - So big that its tough to feel like you make a material contribution</p> review388: nothing in the world everything is great</p> review389: It&#039;s gotten pretty large, which holds its own frustrations at times</p> review390: For all the makes Google great it has become a huge company in the last couple of years and this definitely shows culture wise.</p> review391: You enter into the company not knowing which team you will be working with, and then have to interview with TLs. Some people may like it, but it&#039;s an extra level of bureaucracy I didn&#039;t enjoy.</p> review392: Public image seems to be problematic</p> review393: Work is very very hectic</p> review394: Lots of politics, sometimes people get promoted who don&#039;t deserve it.</p> review395: i would never work their again it was awful</p> review396: You can only be a small part of a big machine</p> review397: Work/Life balance is challenging, but is heavily encouraged.</p> review397: Massive company with an increasing amount of bureaucracy. Really difficult do accomplish anything unless you&#039;re good at navigating a big company.</p> review398: None I can think of</p> review399: Keep you as a temp for a long period of time not as organized as you would expect from a high tech company</p> review400: With time it becomes more like a large company with inertia and all the stuff that is associated with it.</p> review401: Some bureaucracy for decision making</p> review402: Nothing, google is clearly the undisputed goat</p> review403: Can feel too big at times making it difficult to get things done quickly</p> review404: work hard and nothing personal.</p> review405: - like any super large company, tier 1 work can get stale and boring - no clear ladder / path is the sales marketing team</p> review406: There are no cons about working at google.</p> review406: There are no cons about working at google.</p> review407: none really. This is google!</p> review408: The amount of Work Load</p> review409: company is too big not sure about the collaboration between different group</p> review410: Too &#034;Googley&#034; sometimes. Some employees get a sense of entitlement from this. A lot of product designs are driven by engineers, which results in nerdy but useless products.</p> review411: It was contract and I couldn&#039;t stay longer!</p> review412: no support or feedback. let go without notice</p> review413: Being Full-time you get many more benefits and a lot more &#039;respect&#039; for your ideas.</p> review414: It&#039;s a big company and to have a big impact you need to apply some effort. Promotion process is - you basically PR and promote yourself (again, some effort). Nobody will promote you and you need to work on it yourself - collecting success stories and writing an essay why you should be promoted. Crowded office. A lot of people are being hired for MTV, CA office. High compensation is offset by huge rent or real estate prices. Or choose long commute. Healthcare benefits are getting worse and worse (because company is unwilling to pay for &#034;Cadillac&#034; tax)</p> review415: None at for this time period</p> review415: Work hours too long, they want you to live at work.</p> review416: Lack of training, not enough wiggle room for employees to learn from tehir errors do to lack of training.</p> review417: THE MANAGEMENT DOES NOT REVIEW THE STAFF PERFORMANCE IN IMPERTIAL METHOD</p> review418: Not many career options outside of software engineering.</p> review419: no cons, everything is just awesome</p> review420: grown real strong recent, some politics in some areas, incredible competition, sometime shard to motivate people, not always easy to see all the different projects which are going on</p> review421: Most people are overqualified for the job they&#039;re doing; company re-structures all the time which leaves you feeling like nothing but a number. Promotions are not merit based; it&#039;s a waiting game. A lot of poor middle management, many slotted into management positions after re-structures. Chicago office opportunity is limited, not much outside of sales. You have to be a devout self-promotor to have your work noticed.</p> review422: At some point in your tenure with Google, it will become clear that you live in an organization that is engineered to keep you numb, well-fed, and scared of the outside world. (This maybe should be listed under &#034;Pros&#034;, since you&#039;ll gain a sense of empathy for hobbits, cows and children in cults). You will cope with onsite yoga or by spending your bonus on new Teslas. The feeling will endure. The problem with Google is that it thinks it&#039;s Pixar (fresh, zany, innovative) when it&#039;s actually Disney (bloated, iterative, a little creepy). Do you have a really fat mortgage to pay off from that Mission fixer-upper? No? Then find a job somewhere where you&#039;ll actually use your brain and have an impact.</p> review423: Company has gotten immense. That comes with large organization struggles at times.</p> review424: Supply and demand applies. Everyone&#039;s very talented, so the ability to achieve is worthless, those who excel are those who monopolize and hoard scarcer resources. (approvals, visibility) Office politics is 90% of the job.</p> review424: - HUGE company, lots of energy needed to get things done - If you aren&#039;t an engineer, get ready to feel like a second class citizen</p> review425: Upper management should have the knowledge of all the workers tasks and be able to assist and appreciate work being accomplished.</p> review426: Google is a very demanding employer, expecting more than just the bare minimum from their employees. You may want to be on call on the weekend or work late nights when a new project is launched.</p> review427: Need to find the right team. Projects often get scrapped or lose momentum. Hard to grow up the ladder.</p> review428: Google is still a big company, so you&#039;ll deal with the bureaucracy associated with this. Generally, people also work long hours, so you have to be willing to put in the time.</p> review429: At a certain level, some of the business units have very little realistic upward mobility. It&#039;s not that you&#039;re not good, it&#039;s just that there aren&#039;t any available jobs. That being said, when you&#039;re making a bunch of money, how much will that bother you? It&#039;s up to you to figure that out.</p> review430: Most managers are really terrible. You have to work to find the right team.</p> review431: There are no down sides !!</p> review432: The work can be repetitive</p> review433: Getting top heavy and lots of management layers</p> review433: Now at 60,000 full-time employees, its not as nimble as it was when it was smaller, however there still are a lot of opportunities to work on small projects, like in Google for Work or Google Life Sciences.</p> review434: Nothing I can Think Of</p> review435: -company is really big now, one person&#039;s impact is definitely small. -much harder to launch new projects now, with so many processes required by law, or by company.</p> review436: Working at Google as a contractor is like working in a assembly line, NO appreciation at all. Even though contractors add to the more the same or more than regular employees. Very disappointing, I wouldn&#039;t recommend anyone to work as a contractor here.</p> review437: big corporation, poor work-life balance</p> review438: Becoming a big company, loss of Google culture in some areas</p> review439: -Mountain View campus is very remote -Interns sometimes feel like second-class citizens -Some internal projects are secretive and that hurts the culture</p> review440: Tough deadlines with not a lot of guidance. Some tasks can be very vague.</p> review441: hierarchies are cumbersome politics comes into play</p> review442: One downside is that they are always hiring new people, theres a lot of changes within the company, and sometimes it feels that you do not have a boss and its easily to get confuse</p> review442: Daily work is usually trivial</p> review443: Seniority and hard work means nothing to them No growth opportunity Plays favorites Totally a labor job NO Benefits</p> review444: Bureaucracy, slow, not interesting projects.</p> review445: It&#039;s hard to move up if you&#039;re already mid to sr manager</p> review446: You still have to go to work but its really not so bad. Thats life. Everyday basic stresses that could occur but the balance is positive. Not every day so sunnny.</p> review447: As the company grows, your individual impact becomes less-and-less.</p> review448: cubicles are horrible, there are a lot of distractions when you are sitting at your desk. Putting on a headphone does not help when people enter and exit the door about 5 feet away from where your cubicle is.</p> review449: Very low pay for non-SWEs</p> review450: It&#039;s a big company, and it&#039;s definitely starting to feel like one too. Quality is slowly but surely dipping over time. Basically Google is going through more mature growing pains.</p> review451: Low rate of conversion from Contract to Full Time. Not many other cons, simply the best, friendliest working environment you could come across</p> review451: Lower pay as compared to rest of company, overwhelming workload,</p> review452: Things don&#039;t move as fast as they used to. Not because people are slow to act, but because there are way too many of them involved in every single decision.</p> review453: Increasing amounts of bureaucracy slows engineering down a bit The company is now large enough to have crossed the &#034;speak your mind&#034; threshold, where completely free expression turns into a staggering display of what a lack of perspective can do to a person.</p> review454: - Most consumer-facing things you can work on are ad dashboards. - Lot of politics between Mountain View and the remote offices.</p> review455: The hiring bar is very slowly lowering. &#034;20% time&#034; is generally a myth. Internally we called it &#034;120% time&#034;. Google&#039;s increasing scale is causing problems. Some parts of infrastructure are so complex that no one can see the whole picture. Duplicated work and missed requirements happen a lot. As the machine grows larger and there are more parts, the scope of individual responsibility moves further from having real customer impact. Also I disagree with the high level direction of the company. In the last few years senior management has developed and worsened a trend of killing or crippling beloved products. Strategy is never transparent, even as the company maintains that they value transparency. Overall it feels that while engineering decisions are data-driven, management decisions are not. There has been a focus on growth, at the expense of innovation.</p> review456: Didn&#039;t find any cons while working in Google</p> review457: it is hard to feel impact of myself in such a huge company</p> review458: Disconnected from average consumers, products come second to monetization by ads.</p> review459: Very competitive culture so it&#039;s stressful.</p> review460: A lot of employees; hard to balance life at work and home; average management</p> review460: No reason to ever leave campus for the socially challenged since everything is provided on site.</p> review461: Long Hours 60+/wk No upward mobility in recruiting High turnover due to contracting sourcers and letting them go after 1 year regardless of performance</p> review462: There are not many cons to working here, but there is a lot of constant pressure to preform at a very high level.</p> review463: everyone is really serious about their work. lots of competition stress sometimes</p> review464: The company is huge. Getting things done is an increasing problem, and wading through many layers of bureaucracy, approvals, executive changes-of-mind are a constant challenge that impedes one from actually shipping -- even on the business side.</p> review465: Decision making or prioritization process can be much improved. Velocity is hindered due to increased layers of management. Company has grown huge and it is trying hard not to become a typical boring corporation. Really miss those old scrappy days. You might expect to make a big impact when joining this company but most likely you will be spending all your time doing incremental improvements.</p> review466: they treat their contractors poorly. i was hired under false pretenses.</p> review467: Can get a little bit closed from the outside environment. Need to maintain the pulse of what&#039;s happening outside.</p> review468: None that I can think of! But I need at least 20 words, so I&#039;ll babble for a little bit.</p> review469: No really cons. Too big?</p> review469: - Demand excellence and dedication - Promotion is based on demonstrated and sustained impact for a rather extensive amount of time</p> review470: - the marketing organization includes a lot of people who don&#039;t really have the skills to contribute in a positive way. At times these individuals are in influential positions, and can significantly impede the progress of the company. - moving up the ladder is extremely difficult, if not futile, unless you dedicate yourself to navigating workplace politics instead of being productive</p> review471: Work/life balance is stressed by management, but not fully achieved.</p> review472: - Google is a very large company now - Certain teams can be siloed off from others - Increasing hierarchy and bureaucracy - Manager quality can vary significantly</p> review473: Its getting too big. Very hard to try anything new and have big impact.</p> review474: The company has &#034;matured&#034; (a.k.a. slowed down) over the years. It&#039;s not really surprising given its current size. Still much better than Microsoft though.</p> review475: It&#039;s competitive and as it&#039;s grown, it&#039;s become much more bureaucratic. You often need approvals from fifteen different stakeholders (half of which you never knew you needed to consult) before finalizing any project.</p> review476: Getting big, quite competitive on good opportunities, a lot of geek-type persons.</p> review477: As the company is getting bigger there might be some politics going on.</p> review478: -Poor management -There is really weird politics on this team -Scheduling is HORRIBLE. There is absolutely no work/life balance: you get your schedule 3 days before you start working it for the week and there is no PTO since it is an hourly job -Management does not treat you well; there is little acknowledgment for great ideas and great performance -there is a uniform and it is not comfortable -there is no room for real growth: this is definitely an in between job -they say they are all about transparency, but there is actually VERY little transparency -This is not a 9-5, you will work weird hours and you will not have weekends off. Instead you will have a random Monday or Wednesday off and rarely a consecutive two days off -You will be penalized for requesting a weekend off, meaning that you will receive less hours This is the type of job you get when you just really need a job, but be prepared to be treated badly, disrespected, unappreciated, asked to do ridiculo us things in bad weather conditions, etc.</p> review478: It is a company full of extremely smart and driven people, and as they struggle to keep operating costs down while maintaining exceptional revenue performance, this has a negative impact on work life balance. Many people are over-stressed and over-worked. This one Con can outweigh many of the Pro&#039;s.</p> review479: Google is getting big and slow. As you rise through the company, you will find that more and more of your day is spend in endless meetings and wading through nonstop e-mail chains. There are far too many stakeholders involved in every decision, and there is often no clear owner for a particular project. The left hand often doesn&#039;t know what the right hand is doing. Shades of Microsoft from the late 90s - a company that is phenomenally profitable but undisciplined and becoming unwieldy. Many Google employees have essentially &#034;checked out,&#034; and come in at 9:30 and leave at 5, and are never challenged.</p> review480: -Contractors are treated with varying degrees of respect. -Opportunities for advancement are limited for contractors. I only met one person who successfully converted, and there weren&#039;t any obvious resources on the subject. -Stress level is too high for managers, causing them to make odd decisions.</p> review481: Very larger company and you can get lost.</p> review482: Google is a big company, and sometimes things are moving slow. Google is so much engineering focused, and sometimes it is not so customer focused.</p> review483: Hard to make any meaningful impact as an individual</p> review484: Long bus ride to work some days.</p> review485: it&#039;s an engineering company, end of story. im from a background where sales people rule - so very not the case.</p> review486: Though they try to eradicate it, there is still a decent amount of bureaucracy. Also, there are pockets of incivility and bad behavior and Google is not the best yet at identifying and eliminating that behavior.</p> review487: long work days have to stay extremely busy</p> review487: None at all. Great company</p> review488: Lost of competition, can put lots of pressure on employees</p> review489: none, may be its would be good if its onsite</p> review490: Things are starting to move slower; this is a natural construct of operating at as large of a scale as Google does, but the company has lost its start-up feel.</p> review491: Nothing that I can think of!</p> review492: Large company, harder to have a big impact</p> review493: no cons nothing bad to say</p> review494: - It&#039;s a big company - every team at Google has its good and bad side. - Open source for iOS at Google is still just getting started, though things are improving substantially!</p> review495: The office is a little crowded.</p> review496: Things can be slow at times, the bigger it gets the more hierarchical it gets. Promotions aren&#039;t always fair given the volume of people.</p> review496: Engineering driven Flat structure Siloed products Hard path up the corporate ladder Very hard to reach consensus</p> review497: Management refused to talk to you since you were a temp. And you HAVE to be a temp for a year, or more - much more sometimes, before you can get hired on.</p> review498: Lots of external folks brought in agency and consulting type of cultures. It&#039;s a &#034;House of Cards&#034; + &#034;Game of Thrones&#034; type of company on a day-to-day basis. If you&#039;re looking for a career in politics, this is a great company for you - you&#039;ll get more than enough of that. Be prepared to get thrown under the bus oftenly.</p> review499: Only three teams are currently in the area (Google for Work sales, Recruiting, Fiber), limiting career mobility within the city. Three office spaces scattered through town, making it hard to form a wide community with other teams and organizations. Google for Work sales reps are never in the office, making the spaces often feel empty.</p> review500: Some roles are not clearly defined which eventually chases away the good talent</p> review501: Company needs to make some changes/decisions to avoid becoming Microsoft from years ago (bloated, political, etc)</p> review502: Very fast paced. You have to be smart to keep up with everyone else and invest yourself in the company.</p> review503: Big company. Hard to move the needle. Working outside of Mountain View is challenging.</p> review504: Way more politics that I ever imagined. Many people referred to management as Game of Thrones, since everyone vying for the top, inevitably died (got fired). There was often a mismatch between what the execs prioritized and what middle management wanted. Lots of koolaide drinking going on, and the focus on new features is so high while the attention to fixing broken things was really low.</p> review505: Very mediocre and insecure finance management from the old days when a career in finance at Google was not the career of choice but these people just got lucky and now they don&#039;t want to go elsewhere. No vision from the finance management and Finance is not at all effective in its role at enforcing any kind of fiscal discipline in spend. Finance has its own sub-culture where extroverted personalities are valued over people who do good work. There is a severe lack of opportunities to rise in finance and there is no clear career path or mentorship available.</p> review505: Bureaucracy in HR policies; ladder transfers are discouraged.</p> review506: Let me stress that this is a great company but the room for growth is minimal. I was there four 5 years and left because I felt like i personally had very little impact on the company</p> review507: It&#039;s become a corporation. Sometimes it&#039;s hard to feel you can make a huge impact. There&#039;s so many employees and projects, you can be gone for weeks and nobody will notice.</p> review508: Too much bureaucracy and redtape</p> review509: Getting more corporate all the time More and more &#034;fruit company&#034; defectors bringing the 24/7 cut throat culture that they claim to be escaping from Mountain View and Bay Area COL insanity is on the verge of making it not worth it. (Washington competitors looking more attractive)</p> review510: Google is so big and in so many markets it&#039;s hard to see the forest through the trees sometimes. Staying on top of ever changing technologies and knowledge is often time hard. It would be nice to have a few days a year for &#034;reading days.&#034;</p> review511: Google employees aren&#039;t necessarily challenged by their role and often are capable of much more than their present responsibilities; therefore, to make the most of your time here, you should seek out projects and challenges rather than wait for them.</p> review512: For better or for worse, Google is very bottom-up. While it means complete freedom in your choice of tools and process, it also means it can be organizationally chaotic.</p> review513: Location, Compensation, Goal alignment,</p> review514: As an intern, it&#039;s stressful ramping up to get familiar with all of Google&#039;s proprietary technologies.</p> review514: Demanding on regular basis. Some management skills may be helpful to avoid burnout.</p> review515: Not much I can think about.</p> review516: Nothing really that can be a con</p> review517: Complicated promotion process, evaluated on a curve</p> review518: 1. Hard to find an interested project. 2. Not has as much freedom as before. You don&#039;t have 20% projects. 3. After getting familiar with all the great internal tools, it&#039;s possible you do not have the ability to work outside.</p> review519: Near the end of my tenure it was getting too big.</p> review520: If changing job types the transfer process can be a terrible experience. So,e areas quite political. Not enough parking in MTV.</p> review521: Experience will depend on the office you are in, and office dynamics can change tremendously as it grows.</p> review522: You work for a company that has no values what so ever and is doing all it can to violate customer&#039;s privacy</p> review523: Highly political Low accountability Very frequent re-orgs Lots of meetings, surveys, half-baked documents that lead to nowhere</p> review523: I don&#039;t like when I can&#039;t ly deadline when i am working on something</p> review524: Difficult for career growth, harder to shift between teams then it seems</p> review525: I cant barely find any cons. Just a really great place to work Cant beat it anywhere and such an innovative company</p> review526: Commute, cost of living in the Bay Area</p> review527: - Increasingly bureaucratic within my organization, process creep. - Low performers aren&#039;t dealt with very well. - It&#039;s getting more difficult to build internal applications because of all of the approvals required to access data in various systems.</p> review528: All I can see good things about my dream company , Google.</p> review529: The company is so large that the quality of culture is degrading quickly. The bureaucracy only seems to be getting worse over time.</p> review530: I do not have an negative comments about being employ with Google because I love working for Google.</p> review531: Limited career advancement, especially for people starting out in their careers. Very difficult to explore opportunities outside of Human Resources once you are slotted in this department at the beginning of your career.</p> review532: - Peer pressure &amp; the ever elusive performance bar - Mangement bureaucracy - Lack of career grooming - Work:Life Balance</p> review532: Campush-ish...felt too youthful sometimes...most staff are super-duper intelligent but are not growing in professionalism.</p> review533: Too many people. Hard get promo. Good projects are hard to get.</p> review534: Not exactly a con, but be prepared to be intellectually challenged (including during your interview)! Facts, data, and sound logic are standard expectations, not hyperbole, bluster or conjecture - in any role, at any level.</p> review535: The company is just too big. The entire system built around setting and meeting goals turns every employee into a number. If you have a manager that cares and pays attention, you are good to go, otherwise, watch out! You are much better off gaming the system at Google than being honest; your wallet and well being will thank you. A lot of your career trajectory has to do with how often you can get on a kudos email, and if you were randomly assigned to a project that does really well. There is about a 4 year top out to discover if you&#039;re playing politics well enough to stay on board. You&#039;ll find that a lot of co-workers don&#039;t care and just want to fly under the radar, which can get pretty frustrating.</p> review536: Finance at Google was the worst job I&#039;ve ever had. The department is dysfunctional, understaffed and lacks basic process, controls and systems support that you&#039;d expect at such an established company. It&#039;s Oracle version stopped being supported; Financials don&#039;t tie across systems; there&#039;s a complete lack of governance around core processes so every department, manager, leader does something entirely different (and guess what, no one gets along or agrees). If you can land on a happy team, it can be a happy ride. But there&#039;s limited career growth, you&#039;re getting Tier 3 finance skills (because when so much cash shows up, no one cares about a model) and the rest of the organization views you as the weakest link. If it&#039;s your way to get in, great--but don&#039;t view Finance as a long-term success path. It&#039;s a cess-pool of repetitive, boring work that Google doesn&#039;t have the discipline or the patience to optimize, outso urce or eliminate. You will feel like you&#039;re wasting your life. Have an insight? Don&#039;t share it, some Eng lead will just ignore you anyway.</p> review537: too much free food and not enough pods to take power naps</p> review538: It is impossible to have any CONS</p> review539: -Transferring job ladders is near-impossible</p> review540: Not the best place to start your career - but a great place to refine and grow your experience. Working your way up in the &#039;level&#039; process from 2 (entry level) to 5 (manager-level, not a director) will take more than a few years in the larger business organizations - when new hires come on they can get slotted above people who have been working through the system for a while.</p> review541: no cons of this place of work.</p> review541: no cons of this place of work.</p> review542: No bad experiences really besides the long hours i had to work</p> review543: Expensive to buy a house in Mountain View Hard to be productive if you don&#039;t like large open office spaces with lots of noise</p> review544: -growing very fast -no longer as transparent -not very diverse -hard to advance and get promoted</p> review545: Work life balance can be a challenge</p> review546: Don&#039;t eat too much food.</p> review547: Political Dishonest Below Average Management Treats employees as disposable Low Work/Life Balace</p> review548: Nothing to show as cons</p> review549: none really to be honest</p> review550: systems are quite mature, so if you don&#039;t have your own ideas, you may have a hard time finding the right change with potential impact.</p> review550: Sometimes things can get a little bit stressful. If you don&#039;t like your job then you will feel miserable at Google. The people here are very nice and polite (or at least the people that I worked with) and they won&#039;t hurt you if you make a mistake.</p> review551: - career growth is slow</p> review552: Not great pay, startups better</p> review553: Huge company so can be difficult to stand out</p> review554: If you want to excel (no one forces you to) you have to put in long hours and go beyond expectations, helping other team members out and participating in projects outside of your team. It can get tough to balance work and play when you&#039;re working this hard, but really... Who gets a job at Google to be lazy?</p> review555: can be difficult to work in a small distributed office (limited career growth potential), near-constant change (new managers, re-organizations, etc) can make things feel like they&#039;re constantly shifting underneath you and you have no footing</p> review556: Hard to think of one</p> review557: Too many levels of management</p> review558: Nothing. What is there not to like about working at Google?</p> review559: getting too big, slow, hard to get promoted</p> review559: too many work hours, too much to do on campus</p> review560: have to work for more than 12 hours a day. and work on weekend sometimes</p> review561: It&#039;s hard to learn the ropes: you&#039;re given a long leash and plenty of benefit of the doubt (if you screw something up) but there is sooo much to learn and the formal training isn&#039;t all that extensive (though, the training sessions are great). Being able to thrive in ambiguity is a must. You&#039;re expected to be autonomous, which is great, but it&#039;s tough to learn the ropes and when you&#039;re new, you want to perform well and make an impact. It&#039;s hard to do that at first. It&#039;s good to trust your management and team and do what you can. Have self confidence in your value and go find a way to contribute - even if it seems small or under the radar.</p> review562: I love change and a fast paced environment, but if these aren&#039;t for you, Google could leave you out of breath.</p> review563: Sales is the ugly stepchild at Google, and we often feel like second glass citizens</p> review564: mobility fictitious and hard to move around</p> review565: 1. Can be difficult to move up. Being promoted at Google takes a bit of luck in regard to how much internal prestige your assigned team has. 2. If you don&#039;t love what you do, you will be miserable. At Google, whatever your duties are, expect to have them on your mind 24/7. The &#034;work-life&#034; balance is very skewed toward work.</p> review566: Very demanding environment; lots of politics &amp; bureaucracy.</p> review567: When I started at Google in 2007, it was a much smaller company. By the time I left in 2014, it started to feel a lot more big-company-ish, with more bureaucracy and politics. They did a good job of trying to combat that as best they could but at some point the reality is just that they are huge. This isn&#039;t necessarily a bad thing, if you like working in big companies, but I was seeking something smaller and more mellow.</p> review568: A lifestyle more than a job.</p> review568: A lifestyle more than a job.</p> review569: -It can take forever to get to work because there are so many people working in a place with basically just two access roads -You will feel like just a number at times -Promotion is pretty much BS</p> review570: Bad Management in india office</p> review571: Alot of finished work expected of you in small amounts of time. Bonuses poorly distributed. not great work/life balance, most employees are workaholics.</p> review572: Unwilling to admit it&#039;s own size and plan for it, with middle managers stretched thinner than others places in industry. Strongly centered on HQ, and pay doesn&#039;t even buy a house near HQ.</p> review573: Desk space is very small and people are packed closely together in workspaces.</p> review574: No real complaints here, love the job</p> review575: If you are a technical person or have a very unique skill great place to be but if you are a support function of any sort don&#039;t expect to get too much in the way of recognition.</p> review576: Can be difficult to utilize your skills. A lot of the work you do could be done by someone much more junior.</p> review577: It&#039;s a very big company and it doesn&#039;t always feel like you&#039;re contributing a lot. They also tend not to promote from within. If you&#039;re interning in MTV, the taxes can be pretty brutal.</p> review577: I didn&#039;t really have anything bad to say about working here it&#039;s a great company. Some of the work maybe at a fast past but it&#039;s easy to keep up</p> review578: As tour teammates are also very clever, the challenge is to show ypur results in order to Get a promotion.</p> review579: None- a truly amazing company!</p> review580: There are no cons here</p> review581: Management and Directors may have little experience. Most recommendations do not get heard. Will continue repeating failed methods.</p> review582: Being able to keep up with the technology industry can be a challenge but having the right sets of conversations cures that!</p> review583: You work mostly with google technologies and its a steep learning curve before you start getting productive</p> review584: Company is becoming more bureaucratic as time goes on and company size increases.</p> review585: big, slow, benefits are declining</p> review586: - Work/life balance - Too many meetings/emails - Big company politics - Slower career trajectory - Sustaining work underappreciated - Noisy open space environment - Traffic</p> review586: too big now. same big company politics. same big company abusers. So many people abusing and taking advantage of any policy or benefit.</p> review587: The scope of work is a little narrow. They want you to be an expert in your area and you don&#039;t get a lot of opportunity to expand your skillset. With that, it&#039;s hard to make a significant impact outside of your core group.</p> review588: to many people doing nothing</p> review589: - Typical cons that are associated with any large companies</p> review590: very hard to advance from outside</p> review591: The problems to solve are exciting, and the culture is very fast-paced. It&#039;s difficult to &#034;unplug&#034; at the end of the day.</p> review592: Employees aren&#039;t well paid and are undervalued</p> review593: Wish we could get paid for our hard work</p> review594: Uninspired projects and mediocre middle management.</p> review595: Was a contract employer. Benefits were watered down. Pay was dismal.</p> review595: It can feel like Disneyland with a dark side. They throw all these great perks and benefits at you but it covers up a cutthroat feel almost to it. Super high expectations that go up each quarter.</p> review596: narrow roles since the org is so large, challenging/nearly impossible to get promoted given that the employee-base is full of over-achievers managers frequently change every few months</p> review597: There were not cons for me</p> review598: Long Hours are not fun</p> review599: The company is very big. There are more than 50000 employees. The work can get boring at times. For people who live in the city, it is a long commute.</p> review600: Can be hard to climb the corporate ladder</p> review601: The layers of bureaucracy is growing and getting things done at Google is like running through water while there is ever increasing pressure to produce more.</p> review602: zero transparency into future comp, base salary is low in comparison to the market, all systems are designed for engineers (could also be a pro too)</p> review603: Getting too big and losing the startup feel and culture.</p> review604: None in particular One of he best places to work</p> review604: Projects for interns are sometimes not well defined or well prepared for in advance. This has led to some confusion in the middle.</p> review605: Very large. Highly political. Opaque promotion process. Elitist.</p> review606: Not too many, maybe work life balance</p> review607: Bureaucracy is unfortunately extremely prevalent.</p> review608: Traffic and housing prices in the Bay Area</p> review609: As it grows bigger it gets more complicated - more layers and slower decisions, probably comes with the territory after a certain size/employee count.</p> review610: Have to be energetic all the time</p> review611: Not the greatest work/life balance...but, who cares...there is time for that later.</p> review612: Engineers lead the company, which is great if they do engineering only. Sadly, they rule all functions and make just plain scary decisions.</p> review613: Snobby, childish &#034;one upmanship&#034; work culture. Endless meetings. Large campus creating an &#034;in crowd&#034; mentality. It is a rotating door of temps &amp; contractors.</p> review613: Boring work. Too many people. Too much routine work on moving data around. In fact many people don&#039;t follow formal culture, care about their career/launch/good review then about creating perfect solutions and technology.</p> review614: -Coworkers talk about the food endlessly, like it&#039;s the best and central part of their day. Because it is. -Lots of NIH and Google-specific libraries which folks can&#039;t take with them when they leave. The outside world operates very differently and with different technologies, and people won&#039;t learn much of that here unfortunately. -Lack of freedom to choose technologies. A lot of solutions exist on the outside, but there&#039;s often a homegrown competitor that we&#039;re forced to use, so it will make that other team look good (lots of folks write libraries and services just to get promoted). -No Node.js support in production. This is especially painful for aqui-hires because many startups these days use Node. Then they find they need to re-write everything to integrate with Google. -Checkin + code review process is super bloated, anal retentive, and obsessive. This slows down development time considerably. This is especially painful for aqui-hires,  where no one on the team has readability, so you have to make friends within Google just to get your code checked in. Really, really frustrating and the feeling that productivity has gone down immensely. -Still not a good environment for frontend engineers. If you even hint that you like JavaScript and CSS, people will look at you like you have brain damage. Not a lot of the engineering culture values FE work, although that&#039;s a self-admitted problem that they&#039;re trying to change. -Fiscal irresponsibility. Hiring rate within the last few years has been out of control and unsustainable. There is a boom time now, but this is going to hurt and result in many layoffs when the next crash happens. -Engineering culture (also listed as a pro above). Specifically non-frontend engineering. This is reflected in the ridiculous interview process. It would be good to get more diversity of thought and perspectives, not just a hard-line engineering perspective. So many decisions a re based on quantitative data alone, which is a mistake if a company wants to push the boundaries and wants to be innovative. -Entitlement and elitism. It&#039;s not everyone of course. -High cost of living around main campus. You may think you&#039;re getting paid a lot, but the cost of living in the area matches that salary.</p> review615: hectic life in the company</p> review616: Easy to feel inferior when surrounded by so many intelligent coworkers. Impostor Syndrome is quite common, but also acknowledged.</p> review617: Commute to MTV from SF is terrible, sometimes the size gets overwhelming</p> review618: Losing feeling of reality outside.</p> review619: Challenging work environment but interesting</p> review620: location, hard to get there from the city</p> review621: getting big. lots of politics. very dispersed leadership.</p> review622: You have to be able to deal with great amounts of ambiguity around goals and how to get there. Google is a best fit for self-motivated, out-of-the-box-thinking people.</p> review622: Don&#039;t know about the cons.</p> review623: Has the same cons any large Tech company has... - not enough women in leadership roles - women are promoted less often compared to men - bureaucracy problems continue to increase as the company continues to grow - harder for non-managers and above to live in So Bay; too expensive</p> review624: The hiring process - having to go through a &#034;hiring committee&#034; that&#039;s a bit overwhelming not to mention intimidating.</p> review625: Projects in Google can become very big very fast, as they should. But running very small experimental projects has become more difficult as the risk/reward equation has shifted more towards the huge expense of uncertainty given Google&#039;s large revenues.</p> review626: i think it is perfect</p> review627: all the pains that come with working at a big company</p> review628: I have nothing to share for con</p> review629: Challenges might be too much for some !</p> review630: Some challenging work like more than enmities and I like my job</p> review631: Un-focussed and way too many duplicative efforts. The company culture is bias towards action - act before thinking and re-adjust. This is not an environment for folks who like to be thoughtful</p> review631: Working under pressure.no advancement possible on the era were i do work.</p> review632: Super stressful and intense, pace never slows down, hard to stand out because everyone is amazing.</p> review633: Non-tech people have worse lives Exceptional talent means better competition for performance Growing pains: increasing levels of bureau-crazy, people building fiefdoms, etc. Some elitism, though everyone&#039;s very nice outwardly</p> review634: Lots of people you need to know in upper management. You also work long days which really take a toll on your family life.</p> review635: It is growing, and with it is coming more bureaucracy.</p> review636: Overall, onboarding process- There seems to be a disconnect for new people coming on board- lack of training and direction. The company is so big and complicated, internal navigation can be rough.</p> review637: Only to step up and finding new online facilities. Discover more for all the Google facility users. To take my self on the higher level of the company.</p> review638: Working late shifts but other than that I&#039;m okay</p> review639: If you have a bad manager you&#039;re all-around screwed. Certain colleagues can act elitist and seem snooty if you&#039;re not technical.</p> review640: Google has a lot of offices but the most focus is on Mountain View CA. If you are willing to relocate you can have many job opportunities</p> review640: Large and complex organization. Hierarchical. Silo&#039;d. Unable to keep pace with other tech companies.</p> review641: Lots of bureaucracy and &#039;murky waters&#039; (code for general ambiguity) when it comes to promotions, ladders, etc. Standard problems at large &#039;flat&#039; tech companies.</p> review642: I can&#039;t think of any cons for them</p> review643: Very big, bureaucratic place depending on the department you find yourself in. Challenging internal mobility issues at time, not always a meritocracy, sometimes clubby.</p> review644: double-speak from upper management. sometimes moving too fast without thinking. sales on completely different bonus plan.</p> review645: Things change fast and you need to be able to adapt quickly.</p> review646: Career ceiling for non-engineers limits opportunity.</p> review647: As the company continues to grow, teams aren&#039;t able to remain flexible to changing business needs quickly and decision making as a whole seems to have taken a step back. Many mid to higher level management roles also seem to be sourced externally. As a result, upward mobility might be an issue if you join the company early on in your career.</p> review648: There is none to share.</p> review649: too much politics. no matter how much you try to do your best, it doesn&#039;t beat office politics. no promotion unless you know how to play politics.</p> review649: - It is a big company now - Very much focused on Silicon Valley, other locations less involved - Large custom codebase, limited transferable skills</p> review650: Trying hard to maintain the start-up culture, but coping being a mature organization.</p> review651: Size of company means less opportunity for autonomy. I felt like just another cog in the machine towards the end Calibrations punish some good employees unfairly</p> review652: Nothing in particular that stands out.</p> review653: The onboarding process is extremely weak. There is only a cursory introduction to the products via mindless education videos, presentations, and web quizzes and virtually no consideration given to lack of knowledge of an entirely new industry sector. Then you&#039;re quickly presented to others (including clients) as an expert, far far too early. Shadowing and mentoring someone with experience until you attain some level of proficiency is non-existent. Everything is &#034;do it yourself&#034; despite the student being in the worst position to judge what they do or do not know or need to know.</p> review654: All the low-hanging fruit has been plucked. They also don&#039;t care whether they hire nice people or not.</p> review655: Some business areas may not reflect the values that made Google great as it was growing, but those shifts may be necessary as new business areas are explored.</p> review656: Slowly turning into &#034;just another big company&#034;</p> review657: Somewhat random promotion process, flawed interviewing process (no know alternative there). I referred a lot of very good candidates, only one was eventually hired.</p> review658: no space (people shoved together in cubicles) that are inches apart, petty management style, no real room for growth if you are not an engineer. Co-workers encouraged to spy and report on each other as part of the job.</p> review658: The company is facing a changing public perception and several large legal hurdles, ironic as it&#039;s actually very careful with personal data, especially compared with others. It&#039;s more of a top-down, large company as it has grown. Working outside of Mountain View can be difficult. Your experience may vary depending on which division you&#039;re in, though it&#039;s not hard to switch.</p> review659: Layers of management being imported from outside who do not understand the corporate ethos or culture. Changes for the sake of change and justifying a middle management role. Lack of business maturity, lack of structured vision, lack of fiscal responsibility. Restrictive career mobility between job ladders.</p> review660: -As company grows, there are more layers of decision making and it can be tougher to get things done -Promotions get increasingly difficult with each level; you need to be on a team with a supportive manager (if you are not in a role you enjoy and thrive at, it can be hard to switch) -Opportunities for advancement at remote offices can be limited</p> review661: Can be bureaucratic, some people are coasting and thus no drive, and not all Googlers are that bright.</p> review662: still a big company. Legal and privacy restrictions are quite heavy. Internal bureaucracy is often streamlined as possible, but still exists. Revenue growth is slowing, which slows hiring and growth opportunities for some teams.</p> review663: Like any large company, the leaders frequently are out of touch with the individual contributors. Many times over the past year it has felt like leadership has been dismissing the sentiment of its employees. Also, the promotion process largely depends on your manger. Not on your performance.</p> review664: As the company grows, a lot of bureaurocratic hurdles are faced by engineers</p> review665: You are not really aloud to work on any if your ideas. It takes years for the company to start a new project. They do not volume anything you say. Pay is not as good as competitors! The offices look nice in ads but they are really cramped.</p> review666: Nothing to complain, work sometimes is hard but is interesting problem to solve.</p> review667: sometimes need to work overtime.</p> review667: We&#039;re packed like a can of sardines. MTV campus is way overloaded. Wether at your office, cafes, in the loo - people are always around.</p> review668: Company is getting so large that there is less room for impact and ownership overtime.</p> review669: light on processes, everything can be a one off.</p> review670: It&#039;s google corporate style startup environment doesn&#039;t work. Time will tell. the interviews qlarge terrible, but cute. Anybody 20th half a brain can pass them.</p> review671: Sometimes very chaotic environment. Lots of very young, new people who don&#039;t always know the best way to do things</p> review672: No cons. Working here is great.</p> review673: Hours Management Uncomfortable seating arrangements. they try to act like they care for their workers, but the smell of money is everywhere.</p> review674: Low quality of talent entering the company as it grows. This forces higher performers to pick up the slack.</p> review675: Red tape to doing anything</p> review676: It was frustrating to often see your projects being sidelined. Ultimately this drive me from Google.</p> review676: stifles creativity and stunts your growth</p> review677: They focus too much on growing their Mountain View CA office.</p> review678: Large company. Release cycle on my team was slow (Android)</p> review679: For me, the most difficult aspect of working at Google was the culture, which tended toward elitist, both technically and politically. The sense of competition is keen, not necessarily because of the formal review process, but just because hanging around some of the smartest engineers in the world every day can be intimidating. I frequently encountered coworkers who, like me, felt themselves to be &#034;the dumbest Googler.&#034; No one wants to write inferior code or to be thought of as doing so, and for me, the pressure in a public-facing role was even greater. Politically speaking, the culture leans hard to the left and as a conservative Christian, I sometimes felt marginalized by the conversation taking place on emails, G+, and in the office. Still, my immediate team members were always friendly and easy to get along with and i wouldn&#039;t trade my time at Google for any other company.</p> review680: Expectations as to training were not made clear at the beginning of the project.</p> review681: Mediocre pay since it was a contract job. Could have been better.</p> review682: Senior management sometimes acts superior.</p> review683: Managers often far removed from day to day Constant re-orgs More importance often put on meeting scheduled launch dates than releasing finished product.</p> review684: Large company, can get lost in the crowd</p> review685: Can be bureaucratic and takes way too long to get a promotion.</p> review685: Not many cons to weite</p> review686: Many people become too comfortable and complacement</p> review687: Eh, there were some things that it could have done better. I have seen other companies that do different things.</p> review688: none I can think of.</p> review689: Company is growing significantly so it&#039;s easy to feel lost in the fray. Hierarchy not as flat as I thought it was going to be. A lot of red tape that comes with growing pains.</p> review690: Very large company, low contribution</p> review691: - Sloooow...doing anything takes two weeks minimum - Promotion process is byzantine and opaque. Years to get into management - Big-company atmosphere - don&#039;t be fooled by the &#034;entrepreneurial culture&#034;. 55,000 employees doesn&#039;t allow for that - Stand-offish management</p> review692: All housing near HQ is priced for the top wage earners at Google so you can&#039;t buy a house and renting will eat your entire paycheck. Google&#039;s coding environment is designed for the lowest common denominator and twisted to support a nearly infinitely large codebase. 95% of your time will be waiting for spaghetti code to build, fighting code review trolls, following Google code style, trying to figure out bone-headed non-standard architectures, debugging your Google-modified world, wading through endless obsolete documents, and dealing with the politics of egomaniacs pushing their dumb new framework/storage/language/whatever in an attempt to gain recognition within a nearly infinite megacorp. Google uses almost nothing from the outside world so almost nothing learned can be applied to your career elsewhere. There are insufferable KoolAid guzzlers saying they love the &#034;startup culture,&#034; as if it was normal to write 100 lines of code in a day, wait  a week for it to be committed, and then attend a party of 1000 strangers texting while a computerized DJ blasts retro pop music. For all of this effort, regardless of the official project title, what you&#039;re really doing is enabling the creepy collection of marketing data.</p> review693: The company is so large that it&#039;s easy to feel siloed within your own function.</p> review694: Too many reorgs and manager changes often affect your productivity</p> review694: Can feel like a small part of a big machine, portfolios can be limited and become monotonous, increasing bureaucracy.</p> review695: You need to be very bright to keep up with your peers.</p> review696: - Work/life balance - You might feel impostor syndrome for being surrounded by awesome people</p> review697: managers are very political and hierarchical</p> review698: Hard to move to different groups or different functional ladders. It&#039;s almost easier to quit and then go through the recruiting process again because they have a process for that and non-existent for internal transfers</p> review699: As the company is getting bigger and bigger, we started to see more problems. A promotion candidate was declined and the reason was her seniority wasn&#039;t long enough.</p> review700: It is a very matrixed organization. Lots of people have input into a disorienting number of the decisions. Move much slower than people would think for google.</p> review701: - Founders stepping back - Influx of consultants - Culture declining</p> review702: Not much bad to say</p> review703: you have to be competitive to work in google.</p> review703: Tremendous growth and scale has resulted in certain processes becoming bureaucratic and muddled At times trying to do too many things at once. Need to re-focus</p> review704: Amount of critique that the company faces</p> review705: -Middle Management is ineffective, unfair, and self-absorbed</p> review706: Too big. A little lose focus now. Top level management has some business sense issue.</p> review707: Promotion process is the worst thing that happened to google. People start taking on project a that will look for their promotion</p> review708: too many people and too much boring work</p> review709: Racist company towards minorities and females.</p> review710: It is a big company now, and you need to deal with many dependencies and manage complex cross team relationships.</p> review711: It is hard to do from the ground up projects</p> review712: Work Life Balance when scaling for growth</p> review712: Lots of lateral movement Not as many opps outside of headquarters</p> review713: Some issues with paychecks but resolved</p> review714: There are none worth mentioning (IMHO)</p> review715: Company is growing in size, so natural cons that come with that. Feel compensation is something that be improved Work on lot of propreitry tech that is something you cannot use outside of Google or even talk/</p> review716: I do not see anything negative in the comany.</p> review717: The business is Ad based</p> review718: Engineering culture, lack of seasoned business management, immature</p> review719: Watch out for Apple. They&#039;re hot and closing in on our assessment. Jealousy issues between Apps and Droids. Can&#039;t forget about those annoying drones.</p> review720: It doesn&#039;t have the start-up feel of other tech companies... but honestly, it&#039;s more refreshing than an actual &#034;con.&#034;</p> review721: Internal politics/corporate culture, quality of people hired over the last 5 years, products dev</p> review721: Too big. Stock refresh is not great.</p> review722: you always have to be on time.</p> review723: A bit bureaucratic on some teams and in some respects.</p> review724: There are really no Cons to speak of. It is a very fun place to work. Would recommend to anyone in human resources.</p> review725: The cost of living in the Bay Area + the huge commute time to Mountain View. Even those beautiful shuttles are miserable when you spend 15 hours per week on them. My part time job was commuting.</p> review726: A lot of priorities to balance</p> review727: hard for career advancements and managers are sometimes stressing you out</p> review728: - Turning into a large corporation with innovation starting to slow down. - Job satisfaction depends on team you join. No longer enrich cross team collaboration.</p> review729: 6 bosses, one task, 6 different results. Horrible leadership and communications process. Internally dysfunctional and misleading. Additionally they don&#039;t honor written contracts to pay employees.</p> review730: Gets political very quickly as you move up. Also, Google is hiring old school sales people to run sales. It&#039;s horrible. My VP was formerly from Dell and Nokia. Nothing at all in common with Google. He did not even understand how the ad auction works. And everyone under him feels like a number.</p> review730: Given the size, it can be challenging to have great impact on an individual level.</p> review731: Bureaucracy is slowly getting worse. Not too bad yet though. Overloading - a lot of things to work on, not easy to maintain work/life balance at times</p> review732: Big company, too many people on the corporate ladder.</p> review733: Company is huge and increasingly corporate despite efforts to remain scrappy. Very easy to get lost in the fray if you&#039;re not one to constantly tout your successes. Finding the right team makes a huge difference in your success; a poor manager may taint your experience (respect at work is an issue). Work-life balance, though touted, is extremely difficult to achieve, especially for those commuting from SF or San Jose to Mountain View on a daily basis. Traffic both north and south 101 is increasingly terrible.</p> review734: Google is a big company now. It&#039;s not as nimble as it used to be, and I&#039;m not sure that salaries are as competitive as they were when I joined.</p> review735: I cannot see there is i any con</p> review736: Since Google has grown into a large company, scopes for recognition of individual contributions has grown slimmer than before. I hear the culture has degraded a little as well, but the management is aware and taking steps to recover the old Google culture.</p> review737: It&#039;s not a small company, at all. It definitely does not have a &#039;start up&#039; feel. There are so many different departments it&#039;s difficult to keep track, and they don&#039;t always coordinate well with each other. Lots of duplicated work / wasted effort.</p> review738: Tedious to keep on negotiating comp everyday for offers.</p> review739: processes and politics are sadly more and more of an issue</p> review739: Long working hours, long commute</p> review740: this lifestyle can be stressful</p> review741: too big, hard to navigate</p> review742: It is easy to feel like a cog in a big wheel here. Now that the company is huge, it is harder to find interesting projects that you can own.</p> review743: The number of engineering projects outside of HQ seems to be low and can be taken away at any given point in time because they decided to move everything to HQ.</p> review744: Getting larger so feel like you&#039;re making less of an impact</p> review745: Too big a company, too much bureaucracy, lack of shared vision, diversity, trust and respect; hard to make any progress.</p> review746: Bigger offices are in very expensive places to live. Would like the option to work from home more.</p> review747: Many, many intelligent and unique people you are constantly surrounded by that can overwhelm you.</p> review748: - Senior management don&#039;t seem to care about opinions of engs. - Hard to make significant impact at such a big company.</p> review748: Becoming too large, hierarchical. Lacks some focus</p> review749: Slower product development cycle than a startup, reactive porduct strategy (depends on department), 20% time to hack on projects is less like 80-20 and more like 100-20.</p> review750: Unpredictable work hours and schedule</p> review751: This job stole my soul and sold it to a faceless corporation.</p> review752: There truly aren&#039;t any cons here to report!</p> review753: Does anyone in management or in the company as a whole have an EQ over 5? Forgot any ideas about equality, respect and cultural sensitivity. Also forget working here if you have anything more than about 5 years of experience -- they&#039;ll try to exploit the hell out of you and take advantage of any knowledge or experience that you have that isn&#039;t part of your job. And they&#039;ll bully and harass you on and off campus if you don&#039;t give them what they want. Then again, they bully and harass the local community and the local service workers -- the ones who keep the company running on a daily basis, so why would it be any different for someone over the age of 30 who actually has valuable life experience. Not a recommended place to work for anyone seeking job satisfaction of any kind.</p> review754: Single mothers in near Poverty as work colleagues</p> review755: Google is inevitably becoming bigger and more corporate as time goes on. Sometimes leadership will make a decision that seems only to benefit the company to the detriment of employees or users. If you step back, everything is still great overall so it&#039;s hard to complain, but it can be troubling at times. Whenever that happens I just hug my stock real tight and remember that I can always bail if things actually start going south. So far nothing&#039;s made me consider leaving.</p> review756: I have no cons about .</p> review757: beaurcracy makes it much harder for products to get launched. Code reviews take a while. Lots of self entitlement among many employees</p> review757: Company getting bigger and more bureaucratic</p> review758: -It&#039;s a big company now, which means more politics and slower decision making than 5 years ago -The commute to Mountain View is killer if you can&#039;t afford the costly peninsula -Work life balance is lacking in some functions</p> review759: Stress levels, poor work-life balance, promotion process,.</p> review760: Be aware of the Google fairy tale. The reality that I experienced is: 1. The so called &#034;20% project&#034; is already gone. The first day I joined the team, I was explicitly told there is no such thing called &#034;20% project&#034;. I was told to focus on this team&#039;s jobs. 2. The legend of &#034;developer come up with ideas and had freedom to execute&#034; does not exist. When I interviewed and was in the orientation, in multiple times I was told &#034;Google works bottom up&#034;, &#034;Gmail was a bottom-up idea&#034;, &#034;you have the freedom to use your time to test out your idea&#034;. But the reality is: the boss &#034;suggested&#034; a direction that you &#034;may&#034; work on, it was actually an authoritative direction, an order. I once tried to divert a little bit and have my own direction, then that one incident caused pretty bad half year review. 3. Management is fake, hypocritical: a) they say you can have your own direction and your own cr eativity, but at the end of the day they judge your performance just like a worker, on how much your &#034;throughput&#034; is b) they say &#034;Google takes a long time to ramp up&#034; but actually they count your output and rate at day 1, not considering the ramp up time. c) they pretend Google had a relaxed culture, but they took notes of exactly what you said and used that months later as bullets against you. 4. Politics, politics: under the disguise of &#034;Google is bottom-up&#034;, &#034;Developers in Google are autonomous&#034;, there is just tons of politics, power struggle going on. The design meetings become a place for power struggle, and speaking/advocating a design requires taking risk of jumping to the wrong boat.</p> review761: there are no cons at Google!</p> review762: -Doesn&#039;t generally lead to operational work - Some projects seem nice to have, not critical - Can be a transitional role</p> review763: You might not be able to make yourself stronger due to your work at Google is fixed</p> review764: The numerous reorgs on the non-engineering side have left a lot of people disenchanted. In many of those reorgs, people weren&#039;t being recognized as individuals, but more just cogs that need to be put in place for Google to build the next $10BN business. Google talks a good talk and employees believe management. However, over the years employee&#039;s expectations have become so high, that when an individual is in a poor job situation, they feel like Google owes them something better. So you have people who sit in a role/team/dept thinking the situation will get better or that management has a good plan, and they&#039;ll be fine once they give it a few months. In reality, that person is either overqualified for the role or a bad fit, but are too complacent to change. Many employees can&#039;t even fathom leaving Google, so they sit there and hope it works out and will figure it out once the new dream role opens up. But that doesn&#039;t happen and so they wait  it out until the next reorg. The cycle continues.</p> review765: Too many people in the end - too many meetings and not enough getting done</p> review766: Google became evil, they have become money hungry</p> review766: None that I can think of</p> review767: Flat hierarchy. Extremely big company; whatever you do is hard to get recognized.</p> review768: &#034;Hire the best people and give them freedom&#034; is all talk from the head of HR. Make sure that your role is one with enough flexibility so you can enjoy the benefits of Google. Oh the irony that one of the most money-making units of the company is one of the least &#034;Googley&#034; in terms of freedom for employees and transparency of the role during interviews.</p> review769: Sales quotas, very middle heavy. Sales orgs will leave you without a bonus if you don&#039;t hit quota. Pay is not great compared to other networks.</p> review770: Google often can make you overwork, and it can be overly stressful, especially if you have a family to take care of.</p> review771: Horrible work life balance. Difficult to get promoted.</p> review772: too relaxed, too many paper work</p> review773: You occasionally feel tension between what the job ladder will reward you for doing vs what would really be the right thing for the company.</p> review774: Lots of middle management, so there are some great managers but plenty of bad ones</p> review775: Some teams have a very startup like environment that doesn&#039;t suit everyone. Projects get started, some succeed and grow continuing to get funded, others wither and die due to lack of funding and in some cases the eye of sauron tears projects down. It&#039;s a very dynamic environment with a steady pay check.</p> review775: Crowded, frequent project cancellations and management changes</p> review776: MBAs are parasitic leaches that are crushing the culture and long term vision.</p> review777: Easy to get pigeon-holed into specific jobs or roles. You handle a very small piece of a giant puzzle</p> review778: Too stressful. It&#039;s a competitive environment where expectations are high.</p> review779: No major cons, just takes getting used to</p> review780: Can&#039;t think of one at the present time!</p> review781: You have to give in a lot of extra hours, when you are working on a project, sometimes you might end up getting some work done at home. this can be a good thing sometimes</p> review782: Limited horizontal and vertical mobility</p> review783: The company has grown so fast and so large that things move slowly, management layers are continually being added, and the departments/products get fragmented from each other.</p> review784: - company is starting to feel too corporate and losing initial &#034;Googliness&#034; - extremely hard to navigate through - difficulty knowing what&#039;s available in other organizations within the company - career development and coaching</p> review784: - peers are brilliant so you might feel inadequate - sink or swim mentality. you&#039;re expected to be a self-starter and independent learner. they have resources to help you but, in the end, you have to figure out how to learn and get things done on your own</p> review785: bitter large company politics, slow moving, hard to get recognition, comp is not the best in industry</p> review786: not enough money, long hours</p> review787: Working overtime and promotions not easily achieved</p> review788: Some of the challenges is the lack of diversity. Everyone seems to be a white male which is typical in the tech industry</p> review789: Lack of career opportunities and good projects unless you want to move to Silicon Valley.</p> review790: Not much that I can think of. Occasionally gets a little competitive. Expectations are VERY high</p> review791: didn&#039;t get the attention for my work</p> review792: If you&#039;re not working in Mountain View you have very little growth opportunity. You can end up on projects that you know nothing about and have no interest in.</p> review793: It really isn&#039;t a start up anymore, so I do miss that dynamic. Of course it&#039;s hard to stay that way with the amount of success they have had.</p> review793: Unless you are a software engineer or senior exec, your pay and career advancement opportunities are limited. It&#039;s also a massive company, so your experience depends greatly on which group and manager you have.</p> review794: Suburban office location is quite dull. Cost of living is *extremely* high. Total compensation is just okay considering the latter. The salary however, is just plain mediocre. You often learn about the cool things Google does after it leaks to the media, not internally. Many products and positions lack excitement and attention. The sales/partnerships side of the company will always play second fiddle to engineering (no surprise there). Many of the sales jobs are difficult to recommend to bright, high potential candidates. Loud and sometimes distracting &#039;bull pen&#039; style offices. Google is a massive company. The size can be disheartening.</p> review795: Learn everything perfectly, steps by steps. Make the best work ever.</p> review796: Career opportunity is rare. Politics. Things and messes in big companies are there too.</p> review797: Not really any cons of working for Google. An overall great place to work.</p> review798: Definitely felt like a smaller fish in a big pond... not used to that. Although they&#039;ve invested mightily in developer productivity, there are still a lot of impediments. Part of why I left was I didn&#039;t have faith/passion about the product strategy I was working within (won&#039;t say why I left). Bottom line is, I&#039;m a very PRODUCT focused engineer, not a TECHNOLOGY focused engineer... I know that may seem odd but it&#039;s true. If you want to go to a place and grapple with technical challenges on scales you are unlikely to find elsewhere and are not easily frustrated by capricious product strategy this would be a great place for you! Just not for me.</p> review799: Discriminate the lower level. May be not the owner but the management is. As signed paperwork, it said equal opportunities but really is not. Like myself, I work myself off and willing to go extra mile but at the end, they used all of your talent then said end of my contract.</p> review800: No complaints - the people really made the experience!</p> review801: Struggling to maintain the feel of a startup.</p> review802: The guy I worked with</p> review802: Does not feel like a start-up anymore!</p> review803: I didn&#039;t have anything I didn&#039;t like or consider not wanting to do. I loved working at Xeros for any company</p> review804: none really they are google</p> review805: The company is very large, so new processes can take a while to get implemented</p> review806: Facilities are not the best, there could be improvements in the way things are ran.</p> review807: All the cons from big companies.</p> review808: As an intern, the project I was assigned differed from what I thought I had agreed to before I was hired.</p> review809: The location of the office is not quite good. There isn&#039;t much to do during weekends.</p> review810: This is just the inevitable problem associated with companies that amass a large size and establishment in the market, but it&#039;s hard for employees themselves to innovate. Also, there are just too many over-qualified employees at Google who are relegated to simpler roles.</p> review811: Can be hard to advance with so many great people around you.</p> review811: Difficult to advance, lots of red tape. Projects are routinely started and then canceled.</p> review812: There are a lot of internal inefficiencies and chaos resulting from weak leadership, flawed in-house tools, and lack of processes/controls. People are straining and working long hours just to keep the lights on, without much time and energy (and motivation) left to innovate. There are maturity and professionalism deficiencies at many levels - I especially hate the lack of ownership at times (people expecting you to do their job, passivity-laziness in planning, amateurish presentation skills). I thought this was Google? Work dedication, clear thinking, and attrition are an issue in my org. But I am coming from the perspective of Global Business and not Engineering - which is the face of Google and may be better run.</p> review813: Big company - this can be a turn off for some, but it&#039;s never bothered me a bit</p> review814: There wasn&#039;t much I didn&#039;t like</p> review815: Many projects are large and hard to make impact. There are many interesting projects but it&#039;s hard to join these unless you have top-level experience to demonstrate. The bottom-up culture conflicts recent top down trend and there are confusion around the ongoing cultural change.</p> review816: Focus on quarterly quota makes for short-term sales push that can hurt client relationships and longer-term strategy. Sales leads and Managers can go from rock-stars to borderline performer in 1-2 quarters all driven by hitting the number. The googley, we care about our people spirit is hit/miss.</p> review817: The commute from San Francisco can be a little long but is rewarding when you get to work here.</p> review818: gTech is a highly political org with many more layers of hierarchy than other orgs (Eng, Product, Marketing, etc.). This culture spurs unhealthy competition between co-workers who should be collaborating. It also doesn&#039;t make use of individual contributors&#039; skill-sets, resulting in smart people doing low-level things.</p> review819: Sometimes, people seem a bit pretentious. Working with some of these people with large egos could be challenging and dosent make for the best work environment. However, most of the time, the management is very in tune and sought to avoid problems with employees.</p> review820: Hard to move up and promote within the company, lots of competition from other employees than are way better than you</p> review820: - The department you go to will dictate whether you have a great time or terrible time at Google. - Consumer Operations was a really political organization, with folks who wanted to watch out for their own behinds so would throw others under the bus as necessary. In this department, we had managers who were not fit to lead. While rest of Google had flexibility to work remotely, this department frowned upon this which is ironic given the senior director lives in Los Angeles and actually commutes back/forth with a fair amount of remote work. - Be ready for reorgs often and change of responsibilities - There are definite jerks in Consumer Operations department, you wouldn&#039;t think it given the transparent, open culture of Google but Consumer Operations has its own culture. Unfortunately, the Consumer Operations culture is not the Google culture.</p> review821: Although it is not formalized, many people work long hours. Also, it is easy to feel overwhelmed or even out-of-place in the office. The standards are very high.</p> review822: It all depends on your immediate team and manager. Google is so big now that anything you say about them is not true of different area good or bad. Google wants everyone to live in Mountain View or New York with a total disregard for there ability to afford to live there.</p> review823: It is hard for a company to compete with the cheaper lower quality competition.</p> review824: There are no cons that I can think of. It&#039;s a great place to work.</p> review825: slow, no high-impact opportunity, proprietor skill set.</p> review826: Huge company now. Can get bureaucratic.</p> review827: Promotion process can be slow and painful; you have to be a self-starter to identify a team with opportunities for growth and be really proactive about chasing these. Working in remote offices can be difficult from a career p.o.v. depending on what projects are available. Every project I&#039;ve worked on has felt somewhat Mountain View-centric, you have to adapt to that. Obamacare is dragging health benefits down (across all companies, or so we&#039;re told).</p> review828: No work and life balance. Employees over work themselves</p> review829: Lack of Private Work Room</p> review829: A little crowd. Working is somehow boring.</p> review830: No consistent hours. Often called in on scheduled off-days. You can also be call3to work a night shift if you&#039;re on the morning crew. Pay could be better</p> review831: promotions, compensation, smaller offices in remote areas, difficult to ignore the free snacks, too much free food</p> review832: Culture has become more self-serving than collaborative, projects lack thought</p> review833: No possibility of growth in the company</p> review834: Nothing special to note here.</p> review835: Such a big corporation... Takes time to get things done, working as group or individual from another department.</p> review836: Everything&#039;s always crowded. Cafes, bikes, everything. No telecommuting</p> review837: Depending on what area you&#039;re in, work life balance can be a struggle. I think most cons would be individual personality or fit issues, honestly. Google is great, but it&#039;s not necessarily for everyone.</p> review838: Company is becoming big and middle management layer is growing.</p> review838: My team has week on calls in turns. Sometime the alerts can be annoying to some extent. And some problems were quite challenging to fix.</p> review839: All the free food is tough to resist :) Google is a big company, so it can&#039;t move as fast as a startup.</p> review840: Work-life balance can be tough. As big as the company is, there are some extra-lean teams taking a lot on. Also need better gender balance in the workforce.</p> review841: Main offices are in Mountain View.</p> review842: Google is pretty big now. Sometimes it&#039;s hard to tell if any real impact is being made.</p> review843: sometimes the egos are to much.</p> review844: Hiring process is very challenging</p> review845: Office politics, usually not an issue but the &#034;chain of command&#034; can be circumvented for individual gains.</p> review846: Housing near the main campus is crushingly expensive, without being in a city. Commuting from SF is a long, long way to go every day. Rewards for current employees can&#039;t mathematically match up to rewards for early employees.</p> review847: do not know enough to comment</p> review847: Perenially competing with some of the smartest people on the planet</p> review848: Company has grown very big very fast.</p> review849: Huge organization and you are rolling the dice as to whether you&#039;ll get an interesting project and a fun team.</p> review850: • Only con would be I&#039;m not from California and much prefer my hometown. This is the ONLY reason I left Google. (I wanted to settle down in the same town that I grew up in)</p> review851: I can not find cons</p> review852: I am a newbie so I am not as experienced as a lot of the older employers so it is more of a personal thing that a company thing.</p> review853: Many projects don&#039;t make money or are a challenge from a go-to-market perspective so it can be very difficult to attract the talent needed for the role, hiring committee is sometimes our own worst enemy, ad revenue is down and it is felt throughout the organization, there are a lot of jerks and everyone has an edge- they may be ok to work with but you aren&#039;t going to make friends here</p> review854: It can be difficult to make an impact in such a large company or organization.</p> review855: very competitive, long hours, hypocritical</p> review856: Working space could be a little bigger.</p> review856: Some of the delivery drivers are frustrating to work with, the in-store leads act way too entitled because they get to operate the courier phone and give orders.</p> review857: There are no cons at Google.</p> review858: enjoyed my time with Google</p> review859: outside of india, difficult to select , high competition</p> review860: No cons i can think of</p> review861: Promotions are tricky and require a lot of work. In some cases, does not manage low performers well or have a path for them out.</p> review862: Big company so the effect of person is very small.</p> review863: Everyone is a snob. And California is backwards</p> review864: Nothing absolutely nothing. Google works on innovating projects that are thought-provoking, never a dull day.</p> review865: It&#039;s a huge company. It&#039;s hard to stay agile and responsive when you&#039;ve got 50,000 employees.</p> review865: Google can be just a little stuck up. I worked with Google as part of an company acquisition and the hazing went far beyond the pale - they took out a banner ad targeted at my company with a picture of a pig so discouraging us from eating at their company cafeteria!</p> review866: Getting too big, everybody becomes bricks.</p> review867: Must be comfortable with ambiguity and taking initiative</p> review868: i dont know actually maybe the cons are you dont need to worry about where you can move to and there is no need to move forward</p> review869: base pay is on the lower end</p> review870: Great facicilities makes it harder to leave and thus you end up working more hours.</p> review871: The company should focus more on the development side of they newly hired employees.</p> review872: Not a con as such but u should be very smart all the time</p> review873: Zero career growth. Very hard to advance.</p> review874: Nothing to do. Once you get there you could relax.</p> review874: Too many smart people under-utilized Can be way too comfortable, sharp people become dull over time Easy to plateau on learning, due to lack of challenge Can be bureaucratic at times</p> review875: Too many contractors and people without long tenure</p> review876: Hard to advance, hard to get fun projects</p> review877: Big company, so that it is getting harder and harder to start own project.</p> review878: possibly uninteresting projects Hard to standout, hard to promote because people around you all all very good, hard to assume bigger responsibility. Learning curve flats out quickly after the first two years during which you learn a lot of google infrastructure.</p> review879: Be aware that internal mobility between ladders/locations are very difficult in some departments where internal recruiting is low. CorpEng (Corporate Engineering Department) is one of the top department that is applying this policy since management is only interested in their own benefits. Even you agree with some manager for mobility in other departments, they&#039;ll try to interrupt the process. They don&#039;t look at employee&#039;s career/family perspective. Be aware about department you&#039;re joining after interviews.</p> review880: Delicious food results in me gaining weight.</p> review881: Traffic in Mountain View has gotten horrendous.</p> review882: Commute to San Francisco, not a sales organization</p> review883: constant pressure to do more; people work too hard</p> review883: Long commute from the city. Intense. High expectations to perform. Hard to get a promotion.</p> review884: Too big and move slowly</p> review885: Hard work but it pays</p> review886: Peer pressure is very high.</p> review887: -Sometimes people are too intelligent things never get done -Bad manger equals many bad days -</p> review888: Very specified roles. Not a broad range of duties to learn other topics in that field.</p> review889: -overwhelming at times -long hours -long days</p> review890: The only con is that I wasn&#039;t hired directly by them.</p> review891: traveling so far for work</p> review892: Overworked, expected to stay late hours</p> review892: It&#039;s getting more political and less performance driven, everyone is trying to build their own little armies to justify growth and promotions instead of building great products that users love.</p> review893: - Big company inertia - Lack of visibility in all projects - Middle managers are pathetic</p> review894: -little to no work life balance</p> review895: Not much besides gaining weight :-)</p> review896: Company is very big and can be challenging to make an impact.</p> review897: Politics are a thing. A big thing Hierarchy is inevitable with a company this big, but it is a huge problem here Self-entitled and pretentious a--holes are around every corner</p> review898: Not many, work-life balance is what you make of it.</p> review899: With any big org, there&#039;s a fair amount of bureaucracy. Google also doesn&#039;t do a great job of handling low performers: you sometimes have to carry your co-workers from time to time.</p> review900: i don&#039;t think i have any cons</p> review901: Company has gotten too large and lots of red tape to get work done. Should be more leadership development.</p> review901: Compensation is a bit of a black box, but is very competitive to other firms when you lump in all of the other benefits. Politics can be a bit rough depending on the department you&#039;re in.</p> review902: - career management is very hard - too many smart people means your talent is often wasted on trivial stuff - outside of main campus options for advancement are even more limited</p> review903: Too big to move. Process is very slow.</p> review904: Tiny workspace. (My desk is 3 feet and there is literally no space between my desk and my boss&#039;s desk) Crowded halls full of software engineers.</p> review905: The cons are flipped versions of the pros: Google hires very smart people and then puts them in fairly mundane roles. They used to try to take your preferences into account when allocating; they seem to do much less of this as they&#039;ve grown. If you&#039;re at all purpose-driven, you&#039;ll eventually become restless at work, looking for something with more meaning than the project you&#039;re on. You could potentially 20% something, but that notion has always applied more to some groups than others, and the company has tended to downplay it in recent years. More disturbingly, there&#039;s a severe opportunity cost to your side projects: their position is that everything that you do in your personal time belongs to them, although that is not what the employment agreement says and would be an unenforceable position in California. They instead get around this by suggesting that everything that touches the web or mobile (and perhaps the desktop as well) is compet itive with them. There&#039;s a committee that will examine ideas, but it appears to be moribund. Google has grown tremendously, and systematized to the point where it&#039;s a large machine, needing an increasing number of cogs to keep the engine running. The culture has been eroding recently because the company hasn&#039;t been able to reconcile it with its growth, and because the company has sidetracked from its core mission and thrown resources at &#034;me-too&#034; projects such as Google+. I predict that this will hurt the company&#039;s outlook in the long term, as most of its revenue generation still comes from relatively few core activities which are exposed to market and competitive risks. As it becomes less entrepreneurial, it becomes less able to diversify into new areas, and thus becomes less resilient. I would expect this to take 5-10 years to become apparent (the market would need to shift in a way that causes one of their pillars to collapse), which means tha t it may not be an issue for most people considering it now. One other thing I&#039;ve found is that while they care collectively about their engineers a great deal, they&#039;re generally not very willing to go out on a limb to make individuals happy. Food and facilities people are the exception, as they do often take engineers&#039; feedback into account.</p> review906: -Inexperienced middle management -They usually hire degrees over qualifications -The inmates run the asylum to a degree which isn&#039;t always good -Extremely competitive (could also be a pro depending on what you are looking for)</p> review907: They are constantly raising the bar regarding your expected performance.</p> review908: You learn how to be great at working at a big company with limitless resources. Not a great parallel for any other experience at any other company.</p> review909: Large. Complex. Byzantine. Legacy. Sacred Cows.</p> review910: Hard to stand out because everybody so good.</p> review910: Google is a corporation, it&#039;s getting too big. Sometime you may feel undervalued.</p> review911: Sometimes a great deal of overtime is just expected, hard to have a work life balance at times.</p> review912: No issues to speak of.</p> review913: nothing that i can think about</p> review914: no cons, its freaking Google why would they have one.</p> review915: Not growing as fast as it used to be.</p> review916: Becoming more like a &#034;big company,&#034; depending on which department you work in. Becoming more bureaucratic and political.</p> review917: Commute is very long. Growing complexity in internal operations.</p> review918: long hours too much work</p> review919: hectic work schedule, work life balance is poor</p> review919: Overhyped. Not nearly as fun to work in as it seems</p> review920: hardly any! too big, but always interesting</p> review921: Management can have a final say in whether projects get launched or not.</p> review922: none. there&#039;s nothing to say.</p> review923: The cost of becoming big, it does feel more and more crowded. Speed of execution isn&#039;t probably as good as a startup and you do feel like a smart part of a very big machine.</p> review924: Salary is not as competitive as similar positions in other companies. I wish HR would be a little bit more transparent in terms of career planning and position fit.</p> review925: Talent management is a mess, too political, very hard to switch department, employer doesn&#039;t really care about you as an individual</p> review926: With so much going on at any given time, it can be difficult not to want to be a part of it all and focus on the job you&#039;re supposed to be doing. A luxury of an issue, I know. But there are good opportunities to switch roles and teams.</p> review927: very conservative in some field</p> review928: Can not change technology easy</p> review928: They fire pretty quickly if you aren&#039;t up to par</p> review929: Long hours and stress can be high if you allow it to be so learning to pace yourself is important.</p> review930: Not that many to be honest.</p> review931: Life work balance is nonexistent. Middle management at times has a different agenda from upper management. Promotions are a moving target and requirement change year to year.</p> review932: - Management - I personally experienced the worst management. My boss didn&#039;t know how to be a manager, and would always try and steal my work, and then take credit for it later. Super micromanager. His boss way just as bad, and the director of our department is a joke. A lot of favoritism and politics, and ego filled people who think they are entitled. - Constant reorgs, and the fear of wondering if you will lose you job. - No growth advancement. - Bonus was less then promised in offer letter.</p> review933: Google does so many things at once, is constantly evolving, and has so many talented people that your specific role/impact can get &#034;lost in the shuffle&#034;</p> review934: Sometimes it can be tough to get hired.</p> review935: Common issues for big cooperation.</p> review936: Not room for advancement. They say to apply for positions however you end up staying in the department.</p> review937: Out of touch engineers who think yiu should know everything.</p> review937: It&#039;s a large cooperation, so sometimes you are working on a small piece. And even a small launch will affect a lot of user, so you need to spend a lot of time working on details, to make sure you are doing correct thing.</p> review938: very hierarchical and the stipend is less if you are not affiliated with Harvard</p> review939: The corporate culture highly values &#039;scrappy&#039; which frequently means that being thorough and laying down long lasting foundations are over looked in the exchange for being fast.</p> review940: Big - Google is a big company now. Red tape abounds and causes frustration and slow work. Apathy - With the size of the company, its hard to feel like each individual can make a difference. I&#039;ve seen that play out by people not caring about their role or project. This is my biggest worry for Google - too much apathy.</p> review941: Getting too big and bureaucratic, and hence very difficult to have real impact. Most VPs have been around for ~10yrs, so basically churning old leadership without too much new blood - and the old guard are not open to hearing new views, and usually surround themselves with like minded folks. Teams (my experience has been in sales ops and support..gTech internally) are &#034;non-Googley&#034; i.e. reward results vs how these results are achieved. This is a top-down culture. Most sr. mgrs and directors are not good leaders or people managers - lots of cliques, politicking, and naysayers are quickly rejected off the team. Google culture is being compromised.</p> review942: The work is long, and never ending. You stand on your feet the whole time. You never talk to your manager or even know who your manager is.</p> review943: too big to find good opportunity</p> review944: You may feel only a cog in a large machines. Some projects must be done even if nobody really cares. Very limited bottom-up innovation or decisions. There are some amazing projects, really pushing the future, and some less exciting. According to your luck, you may be building robots, or plug-ins for Google Plus.</p> review945: Company has become absolutely huge compared to what it once was and the amount of project churn definitely takes its toll. Hiring is a complete crap-shoot; offers might as well be extended via a pseudo-random number generator.</p> review946: Google is a big company; you need to make sure you&#039;re on the right team. I felt suffocated on my first team but LOVE my second (current) team. Some of my friends have had very different experiences because they&#039;re on different teams.</p> review946: Non engineers are not that respected at Google. Atleast not on par with engineers. Of course, this is true of any company where you join in a team that is not core team of the company. Too bad for the morale, if you are in a non-eng team. Also promotions happen very late and goes through a long stretched process involving a committee and is not that transparent.</p> review947: Sometimes I feel like I am required to live at work. I would like to spend more time with my family than is sometimes expected of me.</p> review948: too big. hard to grow</p> review949: Not many complaints. More job opportunities at this location would be great.</p> review950: Hard to get impactful project, because too many engineers are trying to get it.</p> review951: none that i could think of at this time.</p> review952: - Tons of work means difficult to leave work at work.</p> review953: Lots of bureaucracy, software that is only used internally, not invented here syndrome, and slowly turning into more of a typical large company.</p> review954: - Amazing benefits sometimes serve as &#034;golden handcuffs&#034; for those who ultimately want to be somewhere else. - Performance ratings are on a curve, so you are essentially competing with your talented peers for promotion. Still, despite its pro&#039;s and con&#039;s, this rating system is common among large companies. Maybe it just feels worse when all your peers are super ambitious and talented. - Especially when it was growing fast, the sales organization underwent SEVERAL reorgs. This is fine if you are flexible and open to change, but still worth noting.</p> review955: Hmm, nothing important that need to be added</p> review955: living in SF bay area</p> review956: Hmm, nothing important that need to be added</p> review957: work- life balance. career advancement, salary raises, bonuses paid out in vested stock that takes 4 years to actually pay out. golden handcuffs I realized I made a mistake of accepting the job on day 1. I lasted just over 2 years. The stock, benefits and golden stock handcuffs were a large part of why I stayed. Things are done under the illusion of each employee having a voice, and everyone being equitable in the growth of the company and in deciding the direction of the company. This is completely untrue. Our entire department tiptoed around the manager, gave her terrible Googlegeist feedback, and yet, as if by magic her salary grew and grew whist we were told that we had &#034;reached the top of our pay scale tier&#034; My salary raise was 5 cents per hour in the year that I left. My performance review did not warrant this kind of slap in the face, but my department simply didn&#039;t have the funds to pay me more.</p> review958: Not much work life balance.</p> review959: It&#039;s a big company, and as with all big companies, there is politics. Career growth is slower than smaller companies.</p> review960: the whole process a little long, but ok</p> review961: No Union, no sense of security, horrible working conditions, your not allowed to have a voice. No one seems to know what&#039;s going on, rules change every week. There are non stop emails and sometimes even phone calls during your personal time. Even after a 10 hour shift you only get 30 minutes lunch. You often have to perform the role of 3 people at once.</p> review962: The organization is too flat, considering how fast Google has grown in the last 5 years. Some groups did not promote accordingly and therefore have notable gaps in senior management. Also, I&#039;ve observed some inconsistent hiring practices over the last year, with my group&#039;s upper management hiring people into senior positions that are very inexperienced. It causes a lot more work for the rest of the team, because these managers are unable to make quality contributions. On the opposite side, I&#039;ve seen a lot of people brought in at levels much lower than they should be. This can be frustrating because the promotion process is not simple.</p> review963: You need to spend quite a bit of time learning about home-grown internal tools that you&#039;ll be using in place of popular, widespread open-source technologies.</p> review964: There are many middle management positions that lack clear direction.</p> review964: Grew to big to fast</p> review965: Big company slug, not as slow as others, but still there.</p> review966: Google is severely lacking in gender, racial, and age diversity. It can also be easy to let Google consume your life out of work (i.e. social life); for some, though, that may not be a con. The transition to Larry Page as CEO was rocky, but I think we&#039;ve come out ok, and employees are generally coming to trust Larry&#039;s leadership. Few regret Vic Gundotra&#039;s departure.</p> review967: Upper management with larger than planet egos but with very modest track record.</p> review968: Fast paced, and stressful at times</p> review969: If you&#039;re not in Mountain View, collaboration and visibility is a challenge.</p> review970: The noise and density of the Mountain View offices. I&#039;m introverted, and I have to use earplugs or work from home to work effectively.</p> review971: Work-life balance can be difficult. Google makes it really easy to stay after hours.</p> review972: Compensation is definitely not the highest in the valley which makes it difficult to live close to work and buy a home you would really like to live in. Sometimes it feels like there are too many cooks in the kitchen on high profile projects. As we grow, the perks seem to be lessening. The food is not as good, the christmas present was definitely not as good and it feels like opportunities to feel apart of Google are starting to become more rare.</p> review973: Getting really big. Really noting bad can be said.</p> review973: Lots if A type personalities</p> review974: a bit routine, execution could be slow sometimes</p> review975: Occasional excessive bureaucracy. Whiny people</p> review976: I&#039;ve joined in 2005 and Google in 2005, Google in 2008 and Google in 2013 are 3 different companies. The early years made Google the icon for IT world and it was respectfully so. However as the company grew the engineer-centric and open culture has began to disarray and the people (mostly in mid-to-senior management) that should have never been hired started to erode this culture. Now it is becoming more and more like other big corporations. It is still a great company to work for and far better that most of what is out there, but comparing to what it could have become...</p> review977: It&#039;s gotten very big so there&#039;s some politics, although actually in my day-to-day work it&#039;s not so bad considering the size.</p> review978: nah, nothing is bad about</p> review979: Difficult to get promoted, crazy hours in start-up product areas</p> review980: Usually hires over-qualified people, slow career progression can be frustrating</p> review981: None in my role as a Google Student Ambassador.</p> review982: Nothing was bad about google</p> review982: Company continues to grow quickly, which can cause stress on internal dependencies.</p> review983: nothing to complain about, everything about the company was great and ran to perfection. i would suggest everyone give google a good look at them because they are a great company to work for.</p> review984: Customer Service should be improved</p> review985: -A lot of progression and advancement in the company may be stunted by politics -Salary may be less than ideal -A constant pressure to innovate</p> review986: Difficult work life balance at times</p> review987: Long hours away from family if you have it. Feeling lesser if you dont work extremely long hours. Stock options not very valuable since they got so big</p> review988: is still a business - there is the usual baggage (politics, personal clashes, etc.) though probably less than most companies</p> review989: Less compensation every year. Hired too rapid</p> review990: Constant expectation to keep advancing career.</p> review991: I will lose my seniority, but I do not mind to start a new carreer</p> review991: Constant expectation to keep advancing career.</p> review992: I will lose my seniority, but I do not mind to start a new carreer</p> review993: - can be humbling at times - a little harder to get stuff done than 3-4 yrs ago - overly dependant on one business model and search</p> review994: High emphasis on technical and less emphasis on other skills. If you are a Back-end guy this is the place for you but if you are a front-end and UI person there is less respect to your work.</p> review995: Not enough opportunity for growth. Very hierarchical structure</p> review996: - Impostor syndrome: The flip side of working with so many smart and effective people is that it can be difficult to recognize your own value; if you&#039;re used to being the smartest guy in the room and suddenly you&#039;re surrounded by people who are at or above your ability, that can be a bit of a blow to the ego. I eventually worked through this, but it took the better part of a year. - Slow ramp-up: One of the drivers of impostor syndrome for me was that it took me a lot longer to find my footing and get effective here than at other jobs. Some of that is on me for not asking more questions, but I think more proactive support from leadership might have helped. The environment at Google is very unique and there&#039;s a lot to learn before an engineer can get things done. - Living in a bubble: The perks and so on make life at Google very comfortable. I can imagine that leaving that bubble will get difficult.</p> review997: Some slow-to-respond, out-of-date information to leverage politics between team leads. Contractors have minimal access to corporate knowledge base.</p> review998: Bad work life balance, buses aren&#039;t on time</p> review999: + Can sometimes seem like there are too many smart/driven people trying to each make their individual mark, such that collaborative efforts suffer + The culture seems to be based on the bet that if you bring a bunch of smart people together, something great will happen. Rely much less on strong top and middle management that drives things in an organized way with a coherent vision. + There are many unsuccessful efforts in the company that are rarely talked about. And many cool things are talked about and pre-announced way before they are ready or even before it becomes clear how likely they are to actually happen.</p> review1000: As the company is growing rapidly, and investing in various new technologies, its no longer a company where a small team can launch a game changing product.</p> review1000: Because the perks are so good, you don&#039;t realize how much of your life becomes defined by your job. Especially for those who start at Google early in their careers. Best advice would be to ensure you have a lot of life outside of work that are in &#034;Google-free&#034; zones.</p> review1001: pretty stressful, long hours, and sleep deprived</p> review1002: It&#039;s really important to stay ahead of the group I support, but given things change on a daily basis, priorities are never the same from day to day. I don&#039;t consider this to be a con, but its something to consider. You must be adaptable as well as have a great sense of humor.</p> review1003: Don&#039;t have any cons to add</p> review1004: -Becoming a bigger company -Promotions can be frustrating</p> review1005: None that I can think of at this time.</p> review1006: The work efficiency is low, the management level is low, bureaucracy.</p> review1007: Some people aren&#039;t happy in their current roles and don&#039;t know how to navigate a change.</p> review1008: Start up companies can be a bit of a hasel in regards to stability</p> review1009: if you get stuck on a horrible team, your product can just get dumped in the trash after years of hard-working (seen it in person to some PMs)</p> review1009: Becoming a big company, no longer a place for fast innovation</p> review1010: I don&#039;t think there are any cons</p> review1011: Hard to get internal promotion</p> review1012: It&#039;s a huge company, lower level position can sometimes be out of the loop. Internal communications is not always done most efficiently.</p> review1013: - Things move pretty slowly. Projects can take years to ship. - Your experience will depend on your team. I&#039;ve heard wildly different stories of Google experiences from people on different teams.</p> review1014: Red tap and bureaucracy with management in marketing</p> review1015: Can take time to get things done Lot of google specific technology Lot of projects getting scrapped</p> review1016: Sometimes you are surfing too much.</p> review1017: None cons in this google !</p> review1018: nothing is a bad in this company</p> review1018: nothing is a bad in this company</p> review1019: Unstructured environment provides freedom but a lot of confusion and redundancy as x-team communication is poor.</p> review1020: None, no company can outshine Goolge.</p> review1021: none such a great company to work for</p> review1022: none really, some condescending people.</p> review1023: Big company feel at times.</p> review1024: It&#039;s becoming bigger and bigger. I would rather it stays small but with great momentum. More people does not mean more efficient.</p> review1025: Scale - the company has grown a lot. Commute is bad from everywhere.</p> review1026: Should work and improve the hiring process</p> review1027: Expectation is to perform. If you&#039;re looking to coast, Google is not a good place. The best rise to the top so get ready to work hard.</p> review1027: becoming too big, difficult to see precisely how and where you&#039;re creating/having impact, unclear career ladder, grunt work for new hires</p> review1028: Google is relatively too big now</p> review1029: Despite being an extremely competitive place to get a job, the compensation is astronomical.</p> review1030: horrible management, no training, too many people and not enough hours to work</p> review1031: Any , perhaps to earn less than in a big investment bank but not every one car become a trader or a banker</p> review1032: Becoming so slow, that if you&#039;re not Director &amp; above, it&#039;s very hard to get things done.</p> review1033: It&#039;s a flat organization, which means it&#039;s difficult to get promoted or get a fancy title.</p> review1034: Hard to move up, very political at times, career advancement not always based on merit alone.</p> review1035: You compete against the best. So harder to grow. Too large. Hard to get noticed unless you are a rockstar.</p> review1036: It&#039;s starting to become a little less firm in its moral stances and starting to bend with the prevailing political winds a little too much. In other words, it&#039;s starting to behave more like a multi-billion dollar international corporation than a passionate silicon valley technological trail breaker.</p> review1036: It&#039;s harder to make a big impact now that the company is so large</p> review1037: - In some parts of the company, can start to feel like a &#039;big company&#039;</p> review1038: Career development is difficult depending on role.</p> review1039: Overrun by McKinsey consultants, sales culture is not &#034;fun,&#034; executive management keeps people on their heels, not their toes</p> review1040: Many opportunities are only available in Mountain View.</p> review1041: need some time think this one</p> review1042: Cannot honestly think of a single one</p> review1043: As the company grows promotions are harder and internal politics increases. Interview process is very long (I had 14 interviews and it took months). But hands down it is still the best company to work for in the whole world, period.</p> review1044: gotten more corporate. lots of people to convince to make substantial changes.</p> review1045: Located close to big cities</p> review1045: You can feel that it&#039;s a really big company now - difficult to advance &amp; a lot of red tape</p> review1046: Traveling-lot of it all the time, bad if you are married and have a family</p> review1047: Wildly disorganized to the point where your team, product + general efficiency suffers.So you remain frustrated. HR treats employees extremely poorly. Very difficult to get promoted. Absolutely no work-life balance whatsoever. I thought this was the dream, but was very disappointed in my experience at Google.</p> review1048: While the salary looks high, it actually isnt so great once you factor in taxes and housing prices of the Bay Area.</p> review1049: benefits lead to a lot of entitlement among Google employees. not only does this have an impact on workplace expectations and dynamics, it also affects the larger communities within which Google employees operate. also it is important to remember that as much &#034;good&#034; as Google does, it is a for profit company that makes its revenue selling ads. it might be worth billions now, but that continues to be its bottom line.</p> review1050: I didn&#039;t notice anything bad.</p> review1051: 1) Org Changes: &#039;How Google Works,&#039; by Eric Schmidt and Jonathan Rosenberg does not reflect Google reality. Reorgs take 6+ month and no decision gets made. Resulting in people being idle. Not every manager supports 20% projects. 2) Poor People Managers: Company is large with a lot of middle management not adding value and just delegating. Groups are created because an employee with double digits wants his/her favorite to have a team. Employee feedbacks are not addressed and management pays lip services to fix real issues. HR needs to work for the employee and not leadership team! &#034;Don&#039;t be evil!!!&#034; HR needs to represent the PEOPLE and remove leaders who have less than 50% YoY approval ratings or significant turnovers in team</p> review1052: Very tough for work/life balance. Difficult to navigate given the large, fast-growing corporate culture. Some very arrogant colleagues that weren&#039;t always collaborative and made the culture cut-throat at times.</p> review1053: Of course you do have the information of the world in your hands, this can put some pressure on you.</p> review1054: Google is proud of its startup-like environment and that comes with hectic and chaotic work at times. Promotion can be tough.</p> review1054: - if you&#039;re in the wrong team with a poor VP or director, you&#039;ll see a lack of vision and a waffling product roadmap</p> review1055: None, if you work hard consistently. Problems only occur when you&#039;re not.</p> review1056: Difficult to break through the culture of high performers and academics; People are busy and not always available to help; Product suite not completely integrated into Enterprise Solutions</p> review1057: Requires &#034;genius&#034; thinking (not my problem, only for those who apply to this) Tons of competition</p> review1058: Satisfaction is project-by-project, team-by-team. While you can certainly move teams, happiness is a gamble that many would prefer to not take.</p> review1059: Very deep bench -- if your ambition is to become a CEO, you *won&#039;t* satisfy it at Google</p> review1060: Large that hard to show impact to the business</p> review1061: Terrible place for career advancement and developing new skills: promotions are more difficult and much less frequent vs. similar companies and are just as political...95% of folks are top overachievers anyways, so competition is fierce and slots are few. Flawed leveling/stack ranking process inhibits growth, opportunities to transfer, and eventually impacts sense of self-worth and work ethic (burnout is inevitable as mentioned). Little to no impact/meaningful work at less than a Level 6. For context, if you&#039;re hired as an L2, it&#039;ll take 15+ years to achieve an L6 - and then you can be a middle manager. Woohoo! Sure, you can transfer (not easy though), but you&#039;ll be doing the same menial clerical work for a different division unless you level up and you&#039;ll have to restart your promo clock all over again. Re-orgs are every 6 months, delaying/killing career traction. Layoffs do happen here, but company keeps it quiet. Culture isn&#039;t for every one: very snobby, often distrusting - company culture outside of walls is face value-only. Peers are collaborative only for promotions sake. Lots of bureaucracy and conformity, very corporate culture. Poor camaraderie outside of office. Terrible internal systems. Proprietary Google CRM is a joke. Transfer packages are terrible; HR always finds ways to negate merit increases when transferring by lowering salary, relocation packages are bare minimum (but most people here come from money, so that&#039;s ok I guess). Slowly turning into a conventional company; bloated middle-management doesn&#039;t ruffle feathers, protects selves vs. team/good of the company. Benefits are decreasing as company grows and becomes more conventional.</p> review1062: #1 performance matters, you will have to work hard, work smart, and grow #2 it can be very demanding and ask a lot of you, require long hours sometimes</p> review1063: The work life balance isn&#039;t what it seems, you really do need to work extremely hard to get ahead. It&#039;s in the advanced stages of becoming another big company, so you&#039;ve really lost the sense of intimacy and flexibility that came with a smaller company. The reorgs that happen every 2-3 years get old after awhile as you&#039;re constantly reshuffled to new teams and managers.</p> review1063: The work life balance isn&#039;t what it seems, you really do need to work extremely hard to get ahead. It&#039;s in the advanced stages of becoming another big company, so you&#039;ve really lost the sense of intimacy and flexibility that came with a smaller company. The reorgs that happen every 2-3 years get old after awhile as you&#039;re constantly reshuffled to new teams and managers.</p> review1064: the pay is low if you do not have a lot of traffic to your website.</p> review1065: Google is a fast moving and constantly evolving environment. This can be a strength or it can be a weakness, depending on your ability/ desire to keep up..</p> review1066: Senior management seems to loose interest in initiatives easily. Culture isn&#039;t as good as everyone thinks. Lots of egos.</p> review1067: Too many cooks in the kitchen at the employee /junior manager level. Constant changing of direction and priorities. Hard to focus.</p> review1068: Large company now makes getting things done slower.</p> review1069: Political in terms of promotion Metrics are used to track performance to a tee - at least 8 different metrics were added to performance assessment in the span of 6 months</p> review1070: - Performance tracking is a little more cut throat then I&#039;d have liked, with the risk of quickly escalating work environment between peers from friendly competition to rivalry - With so much going on, it&#039;s easy to get lost in the noise. This company was founded on DATA! and making it meaningful and available, that means you need to have proper organizational skills going in so you can effectively manage your time and make every work second count!</p> review1071: life work balance is not so good</p> review1072: - Google is getting bigger and more liks a corporation</p> review1072: No sense of overall direction. No sense of ownership of achievement. Makes you feel like a tiny cog in a giant machine. 1000&#039;s of genius engineers with nothing better to do than pick on each other.</p> review1073: Google has gotten really large, and depending on where you are in the company, some bureaucracy and politics can get in the way. The company is very conscious of it, though, so it&#039;s less than you might see at other companies of this size. Launching is also the main emphasis -- it&#039;s hard to hire some of the brightest people in the world and ask them to just maintain some code base. Almost everyone is very entrepreneurial and always want to be working on new things, so maintaining things and following through of things can sometimes be difficult.</p> review1074: training, onboarding, some department&#039;s culture are not Googley and could trap you in an area that prevents you from moving to other areas, commute from SF</p> review1075: There are literally no cons to this internship.</p> review1076: Huge company with a lot of bright people results in a lot of constant competition</p> review1077: The politics.... Google, being that it is becoming so large, the game of favorites tends to be played alot. I&#039;ve never had to encounter this being a problem for myself, but have seen this happen to truly qualified team members surrounding me. It can have a college feel to it at times - Gossip, Gossip, Gossip. (but, that can be said for all companies at some point)</p> review1078: Not all jobs at Google are great. Some of them might be on bad projects or ineffective teams. If this happens to you it&#039;s probably in your best interest to transfer to another team.</p> review1079: Lots of people, can get lost</p> review1080: - Complicated cross-functional organization design - company is organized around products vs. marketing &amp; sales. Hard to coordinate and move people across functions to action</p> review1081: Sometimes there is too much complexity built up to do something simple. You can often fix that, but it may be hard to orchestrate work across geographies and teams since many people have loads of work.</p> review1081: Getting guidance from higher management. Work, life balance.</p> review1082: Almost cult like employee following</p> review1083: Haven&#039;t found any cons yet</p> review1084: non responsive managememnt. also, difficult to advance</p> review1085: Not a good company to work for.</p> review1086: It is getting a big company - so politics is creeping in, a lot of slack in pockets.</p> review1087: Cost of living high In California.</p> review1088: not much growth space, no good career path</p> review1089: High stress, fast-paced environment. Getting so big that it can feel very bureaucratic.</p> review1090: Long hours, not enough remuneration, upper management little arrogant but apart from that, a great place to work and learn and gain experience.</p> review1090: The only con is that overall, if you are not interested in Sales, there is very little opportunity outside of New York or Moutainview which can lead to lack of a long-term career.</p> review1091: Entitlement, damaging competitiveness, and misogyny just to name a few. Throw an ineffective HR team in the mix and it is actually not a very supportive or pleasant place to work. I worked in a group that was dominated by men who actively did not like women. My male boss actually stated in a 1:1 with me once that he though several recent promotions were to fill some sort of &#034;promote women quota&#034; and that some of the women promoted did not actually deserve it based on their performance or skills. He actually said this to me, a woman. I did mention this to my HRBP and her response was &#034;do you want me to do something about that?&#034; A completely inappropriate response. Only young white men from top level universities and very masculine women were hired into our group, I was reorganized into the group my second year at Google and was shocked and disturbed by the environment on the team i joined. Work life balance was a joke and the only appreciation a nd recognition I received was from the internal client groups I supported. I would not recommend working at Google to anyone and would say that women in particular need to think long and hard before going to work there. I think there is a lot of bullying, bias and harassment happening in the group I was in and HR should know about this as many people have raised it and no action towards improvements are being taken.</p> review1092: Hard to find free time outside of work. My family started to become distant and I came to the realization that I needed to spend more time with them. Hopefully Google will offer more work from home and vacation opportunities.</p> review1093: Employees don&#039;t feel comfortable/safe giving feedback about managers because they&#039;re too protected by the next manager. Be wary of who your hiring manager will be.</p> review1094: Gets a bit political as you climb up the ladder. Not toxically so, but still annoying.</p> review1095: Upward mobility is hazy Compensation isn&#039;t what I expected</p> review1096: Promotion and micromanagement on the recruting team for tech</p> review1097: grows relatively steadily and stably, possibly fewer opportunities here than in startups</p> review1098: should have more input in the contracts they hand out to various companies like astreya</p> review1099: tougher and harder to compete</p> review1099: difficult work, takes time, can be stressful</p> review1100: Very smart people in all divisions, can be hard to stand out at times. Lots of brogrammers and Stanford kids.</p> review1101: It&#039;s a big company. Hard to make an impact outside your project / team, and easy to get lost. If you&#039;re entrepreneurial and want to act like an owner at a company level, this is not the place for it.</p> review1102: Vague career path for TA professionals,</p> review1103: Management doesn&#039;t seem to care about anything except making themselves look good to their superiors. They have their little clique of cronies that make decisions behind the scenes without any input from the worker bees. Few opportunities for career growth, unless you kiss the proverbial ring. FTE compensation is mediocre and heavily stock-driven. If you stay for 5-10 years, you&#039;d be set from accumulating Google stock...anything less than that and you are making below industry standard. Bonuses are laughable for high performers.</p> review1104: Many new things to learn</p> review1105: Can&#039;t bring my dog, traffic is bad</p> review1106: Competence of directors varies from team to team, bureaucracy can be a challenge.</p> review1107: micro managed, little personal life, work up to 60 hours a week and terrible benifits</p> review1108: Offices only in places I don&#039;t want to live.</p> review1108: The company has slowed down to the point of frustration and re-orgs are far too common.</p> review1109: Sometimes the direction can be a cluster...</p> review1110: don&#039;t know yet, will find out inevitably</p> review1111: Cons? whats cons? There are no cons of working at Google</p> review1112: which I can work remotely a few days out of the week. Too many projects at one time</p> review1113: Absolutely loathed the commute from SF. Huge time suck from my life. Politics left me tired. Couldn&#039;t focus on the product.</p> review1114: office moves are frequent to find room for growth</p> review1115: It&#039;s such a big company that it is impossible to keep standards high. As a result there are people there that should be fired but can&#039;t because a large company is an easy target.</p> review1116: very big. have a little bit stuff can be determined by you</p> review1117: work on small things; lots of doc/design reading</p> review1117: Everyone, and I mean EVERYONE wants to ask me questions about Google, if I like it, is rumor XYZ true, ... etc. Also, just about everyone within 3 degrees of me in places like LinkedIn have asked for jobs. Even the Barista at Peets asked for a job.</p> review1118: Nothing negative. Just personal relocation.</p> review1119: Time was always a problem. The clocks never worked.</p> review1120: Amateur management. Beyond the point of being disrespectful at times. I&#039;ve seen this from the top leadership time and again. Eventually I had to leave because of a conflict with personal values. Funny thing is, those at the top were simply there first/ longest, and they are generally less competent than many of the most junior employees. Heavy bureaucracy. Kinda ridiculous to see how tactical management can get (I mean,the CMO providing feedback on a product web site), and the sheer lack of a well communicated strategy for the business (ie, I do think Larry sets a good company vision and priorities).</p> review1121: Some problems are challenged and sometimes it is hard to meet the requirement.</p> review1122: crowded, competing for talent, remote offices</p> review1123: Google is beset by internal competition -- the atmosphere of constant review pushes people to primp their resumes and do things to look better and make their competition look worse. Unscrupulous, loud people are rewarded, while ineffective people are treated similarly to those that actually do great work. The company is full of managers who don&#039;t really know how to manage. Working conditions offer no privacy and detract from concentration: wall-less elbow-to-elbow bull pens. Corporate Management insists on recruiting mostly at headquarters (Mountain View) despite the growing issue of insufficient housing for new hires. Employees live in the substandard housing nearby or yoke themselves for life to pay a mortgage on some place nice. Worst of all, much of management is running out of ideas. Almost every product they&#039;ve produced was brainstormed fifteen years ago. The dream of the &#034;Star Trek&#034; computer is basically accomplished, and they now have t ens of thousands of software engineers to employ doing... what, exactly?</p> review1124: No cons or negatives at all</p> review1125: Inconsistent, sometimes poor personnel policies. Lots of hiring hiccups. Not a company designed for people over 35. Many current employees will give Google 5 stars, but note: when it&#039;s good, it&#039;s very good, but when it&#039;s bad, it&#039;s incomprehensibly bad.</p> review1126: This may not apply to the entire company because my experience was in the Human Resources department. It has become bureaucratic and very political. Maybe this is part of being a 50,000+ company. There&#039;s too much red tape that slows down the ability to get things done. Also, success is becoming dependent on who you know and how much you sell yourself. It&#039;s no longer about your accomplishment or abilities. Title and level are becoming more important.</p> review1126: Since it&#039;s becoming bigger and bigger, you get the feeling that you&#039;re contributions are not making a big impact. Which leads many googlers to leave after 18 months.</p> review1127: Everyone is super-smart and constantly tries to prove it, which can be very tiring Once you scratch the surface you realise that there are too many projects and not enough people to do them.</p> review1128: Very free, and some become not productive.</p> review1129: If you end up on a project you aren&#039;t all that interested in or a team you don&#039;t quite mesh with, you may not enjoy your work as much as you could if you were placed on another team/project, though it seems fairly painless to switch teams if you aren&#039;t enjoying what you do anymore.</p> review1130: At many times wanted a more rigid environment.</p> review1131: Some managers are great technically, but have no people skills whatsoever. Also, the level of work and output by your peers is very high. You have to learn to work smart to make your work-life balance fit. This means learning how to effectively use the tools (which takes time, but they&#039;re really good), to build discipline to avoid spacing out on random websites, and actively managing your time. You also have company policies (easy to work from home, flexible hours) to make that happen.</p> review1132: Work, work, work, work, work, work and more work. Life there is tough, don&#039;t let the benefits suck you in, because behind the fatherly support, is a more ulterior motive to keep you there long, long hours by taking care of you so well. Work / life balance is tough. If your young with no life outside of work, this is a dream come true. With a family of young kids, think before you jump ... but there are worse things like doing the same hours in a likely to fail start-up so it is not all bad.</p> review1133: Not much change in pay until a very long time . Pay is good but stagnant</p> review1134: Capricious high-level management direction, some projects don&#039;t make sense. Working across many time zones in distributed offices is challenging at times.</p> review1135: Individual team/group culture varies widely, some are a lot more &#034;fun&#034; to work on than others.</p> review1135: nature of work is more rote than it used to be (what with the onset of &#034;big company culture&#034;). harder and harder to be heard over the sea of voices despite (or perhaps because of) open culture.</p> review1136: poor work-life balance for higher-level employees. if you are a higher-level hire with a masters degree you will find a high level of expectation from you starting on day 1, disorganized on-boarding training programs for new hires leaving you to sink or swim and figure things out on your own,</p> review1137: The way the operation was ran was by far the worse</p> review1138: None that I can think of off the top of my head.</p> review1139: If you want work-life balance, you have to be the one to take the initiative. It won&#039;t just be handed to you.</p> review1140: It is becoming very big and the perks are slowly falling off. This also makes it go slower than previously</p> review1141: It&#039;s a really big company, and suffers some inevitable big company problems like politics and internal mobility an be more difficult than one would imagine.</p> review1142: -Big company, Political environment. -Quantity get higher precedence over quality. - Google Recruiting culture is different from the company.</p> review1143: It is extremely competitive here.</p> review1144: Promotion seems to be a question of meeting the official company roles and responsibilities for each level, rather than contribution to the bottomline. People skew younger, which can be a drag on getting things done because 90% of people seem to be on the wrong end of a generic working life learning curve (rather than actually learning about new products and figuring out how to sell them).</p> review1144: It&#039;s become a big company. It&#039;s one of the best, if not the best, big company in the world, and I still love Google. But if you&#039;re ambitious and really want to be in the ground floor of exciting new projects, Google isn&#039;t always the easiest place to do that.</p> review1145: Pretty big company and hard to learn what everyone else is doing</p> review1146: Contractors get paid more than FTEs</p> review1147: mundane work not vibrant not much people interaction</p> review1148: Big company issues - hard to grow scope and have an individual impact.</p> review1149: Internal competition, more top down these days than before, but still better than any other company outside. Too many Directors (compared to T7s), many incompetent ones, very difficult to move up in some part of the company, which serves as a reason why competent people leave.</p> review1150: It can sometimes be a little stressful, because there&#039;s a lot to be done. Hours can be long.</p> review1151: Disorganized management Arrogance and complacency are rampant (think Micro$oft in the 90&#039;s) You can&#039;t trust your co-workers A collection of failed attempts to diversify, kept afloat by one cash cow (depressing to everyone not working on search) Most managers actively sabotage your efforts at working on a 20% project -- very frustrating.</p> review1152: Sometimes, hard to get a promotion. The work itself can be very challenging, and at times, colleagues may not be willing to help get you through tough codes or working experiences.</p> review1153: stressful at times, they would for you to completely move i</p> review1153: the cost of living in the bay area and the long working hours make it tough to continue motivation and standards</p> review1154: Demanding bosses No connection to any one inside low sallaries.</p> review1155: Little leadership. Hours can be long, but hey, that&#039;s life.</p> review1156: upward mobility is stagnant. perks can make most complacent and satisfied with their role level for years with no title promotions.</p> review1157: Growth stagnates after certain level.</p> review1158: Felt pigeonholed in my roll.</p> review1159: Google can be extremely competitive and is unrelenting in its pace. More importantly, for senior or mid level management you can hit a glass ceiling. The company is very product / eng driven which can at times be frustrating for sales &amp; marketing people. Google is not organized structurally for employees looking for GM or P&amp;L experience. It&#039;s too functionally structured for that. If you want to eventually manage a business then unless you&#039;re a product / eng person this might not be the right place for you.</p> review1160: Can&#039;t think of any cons!</p> review1161: There aren&#039;t really any cons, It&#039;s just hard to advance if your not in a top project team.</p> review1162: I just can not find one con for this job</p> review1162: The mirage of work/life balance is really convincing. Bosses do not model balance and climate has become selfish and brutal over the past 7 years. Definitely embarrassed to say that I work here.</p> review1163: not a lot of growth and minimum pay</p> review1164: You haven&#039;t seen politics like this Neverland before. Rich people that got in early, or industry professionals who have had too much reality to adapt is the norm. Ivy League MBAs are a dime a dozen. Egos are huge, and sometimes warranted. You will feel small time, and like an idiot for a long while after you start.</p> review1165: - Management - Lack of career pathing - No work life balance</p> review1166: People in the office were a little snooty tooty or stuck up.</p> review1167: The work itself can be lame in many areas of the company. Constant evaluation and stack ranking. Frequent feeling that what you do doesn&#039;t help the company. Many, many layers of management.</p> review1168: Management sucks, and the company direction is heading south. They&#039;re focused on competitors that aren&#039;t real, and on the wrong forms of public opinion.</p> review1169: It&#039;s a big place, spread out across many locations. Though it&#039;s a positive when it comes to travel, it can be a little challenge for getting to know others and to be known yourself.</p> review1170: Google will let you balance your life, but unless you&#039;re really good, expectations are high and a lot of overtime will be needed to reach up the ladder. Google won&#039;t force you, but it is still a meritocracy.</p> review1171: The bottom-up culture is not for everybody. It can sometimes feel chaotic, as if managers can&#039;t decide what they want. That&#039;s because the culture of the company is &#034;try things and see what works.&#034; It is a good company if you thrive on uncertainty and autonomy; it is less good if you are looking for clear, consistent directions.</p> review1171: Worst part is the interview process, but once you get past that there&#039;s very little to complain about. There&#039;s a bit of bureaucracy associated with larger companies, but not nearly as bad as at other places of similar size.</p> review1172: work-life balance issues, high living expenses</p> review1173: Getting stuck in the middle of bad management really turns your work life upside down.</p> review1174: Sometimes the management is well structured.</p> review1175: moving slow growing into a big company</p> review1176: WLB can be tough, sometimes. They give you a lot of leeway and expect a lot in return. Creating the future has a price, you know.</p> review1177: Keeping up with the ever changing world of google</p> review1178: Not much in terms of team. Each person out for themselves.</p> review1179: - The company is getting larger, and can be harder to navigate - Everyone would be a top performer anywhere else, which raises performance standards and stress - As the company grows, everyone starts to feel a little more anonymous</p> review1180: No real cons come to mind.</p> review1180: Too large one can get lost in the megaplex. At higher levels it can get more and more political. Not much use of open source infrastructure beyond Linux</p> review1181: Hard to make a difference.</p> review1182: I don&#039;t have any cons right now. Maybe that it&#039;s a bit hard to understand career paths but that&#039;s super minor</p> review1183: Company is now big which means more processes.</p> review1184: Job can get a little redundant</p> review1185: Everyone I&#039;ve worked with is incredibly smart (and nice). I don&#039;t view this as a con but if you are used to being the big fish in a small pond it might be an adjustment.</p> review1186: Everybody is smart, so it does get very competitive. Promotions get unduly given to folks at times. There is a strong focus on operating efficiency which is good, but it does tend to clash with the free-flowing culture of the company.</p> review1187: The review process, at least when I was there, was very time-consuming and after a while it seemed to lose meaning,</p> review1188: Well I can&#039;t say much but when you start out it may be very nerve racking but with the help you get you can feel right in the community!</p> review1189: No clear guidance on career progression</p> review1189: Big company so scope of responsibility is not as big</p> review1190: Overheads of checking in codes, politics in certain groups. Sometimes people are spending a lot of time working just on trivial stuff.</p> review1191: Hard work, stressful situations with management.</p> review1192: Hard to feel like you make an impact; convoluted career advancement procedures (need to always be strategizing around leveling up). Since the company is so big, you have to make a concerted effort to grow your skill set outside of your immediate world.</p> review1193: Even the best big companies have some amount of politics and some amount of duplicate or discarded work. Plus, when you&#039;ve got a lot of people working on something, the work is sharded into smaller and more specialized bits, and some of those are naturally less interesting than others.</p> review1194: - You can feel that it&#039;s a really big company now - difficult to advance &amp; a lot of red tape - Most opportunities are in Mountain View HQ - a horrendous commute no matter how you swing it if you&#039;re living in SF -Many teams have an &#039;ivy league only&#039; culture that can be stifling -Email and meeting culture can be real time sucks</p> review1195: Work/Life Balance is extremely hard. I don&#039;t know why they insist on turning us into slaves. If you have a bad manager, your experience will surely be ruined.</p> review1196: Busier than most big companies, which is both good and bad</p> review1197: Not quite as exciting as some other companies. Food isn&#039;t as good as it used to be. You might be exposed to the tiniest bit of politics if you make it high enough. Nothing but first world problems.</p> review1198: There is no con about google its amazing</p> review1198: Sometimes the environment is too nice. As changes cascade down from top management mid level management does not speak up and question or say no. This is not different from other companies, but with the culture there you would not expect it to happen so often.</p> review1199: * Lots of competition from all the very smart coworkers. Promotions are challenging.</p> review1200: Expectations are high, and processes can get in the way. People tend to have strong opinions.</p> review1201: Because the bar is so high and the pool is so talented, it seems that sometimes people would would excel at other companies have a hard time keeping up here.</p> review1202: Influx of consulting arrogance at the senior levels. Competitive. Regional offices are not quite like Mountain View.</p> review1203: You won&#039;t work at the speed of a startup, even if you join a small team.</p> review1204: None :) The culture was decent and the pay was great. I really liked this company and I am trying to work for them again it was awesome.</p> review1205: Promotions are very hard to get</p> review1206: Company is getting big, and not everyone is moving as fast as we were before. There are clearly hierarchy, and most of time it doesn&#039;t equate bureaucracy but sometimes it does .</p> review1207: Low attention span means that projects change a lot, but that also means faster innovation so its a double edged sword</p> review1207: work longer time than normal company</p> review1208: Company is getting huge, hard to navigate organization. I still believe its one of the best run large companies but at some point an organization will just get too large and loses the agility and speed that it had before.</p> review1209: Difficult to move up and take on more challenging roles. Not a great place to begin a career outside of engineering</p> review1210: communication is all over the place</p> review1211: Very corporate now. The company is hierarchical and there is little to no access to management at the top. Long hours and no work life balance.</p> review1212: If you get stuck with a bad manager, it can really ruin your experience a bit. Need to know how to navigate the corporate structure in order to be successful.</p> review1213: Not as much freedom to innovate as one might expect. The quarterly review cycle tends to throw out the idea of trying for a longer term vision.</p> review1214: No balance between work and personal life</p> review1215: The sales org is a big bureaucratic mess. Most decisions are made by upper management with a very short-term focus - and everyone has to play along - to get that director his/her next bonus. Promotions are 100% driven by politics vs. how you perform in your core role. There are much better parts of the company to be in - but you won&#039;t be able to get in to them in the Ann Arbor office. The good roles are all centralized in Mountain View. HR here is evil. Any move you make, they will look for ways to claw back your merit increases and even make you sign that you will not negotiate salary if you get an offer. Then give you a poor offer.</p> review1216: The fabulous perks are there to keep the highly skilled employees complacent while they perform the menial, repetitive, labor that is required to keep the machine running. On any given eventing, many a Googler can be heard lamenting his/her under-stimulating project at any given Palo Alto watering hole.</p> review1216: While company is great, your particular team and work experience could be awful. You could work really really long hours and pick up the slack for the rest of the team. Many managers hire accomplished and seasoned staff, primarily, to make up for their own lack of experience and knowledge. So you may find yourself without proper guidance, and in the position of a workhorse. This company is best for people who join fresh out of college and grow within the org....many others, will be taking many steps back in their careers and work hard and long on a job that can be frustrating just to be a &#039;googler&#039;.</p> review1217: Bad management, some leaders take things not so seriously</p> review1218: People are human, they are not technology slaves.</p> review1219: None. I mean it. It is a corporation now, but still most of the things are very very reasonable</p> review1220: Too many people doing jobs they&#039;re overqualified for. This leads to increased employee dissatisfaction and turnover. It can also cause a bit of overhead as intelligent people look to inject meaning/impact into low impact roles. Also be cautious of the job descriptions when applying. They can be intentionally vague and you may end up doing something you have absolutely no interest in. Far too often have I seen a person take almost any job just to get in the door and end up miserable.</p> review1221: No specific order: Smartest people in Junior roles causes complacency Jealousy: Concept/ idea stealing, lack of integrity. The way Temps / Consultants are treated as 2nd class citizens People get lazy and tend to meet virtually in the same building. = no human connection Not friendly people that sit around you don&#039;t say hello and if you do, wow the strangest reaction! Abundance of younger (mid 20&#039;s) fresh out of MBA programs= no real job experience. The Google High lasts about 2 weeks then you realize all the perks are to cover up the companies incompetence. Unless you&#039;ve been with the org for years it&#039;s nearly impossible to set a career trajectory If you don&#039;t work under a product team you&#039;re just background.</p> review1222: sketchy. too many high paying jobs</p> review1223: Speed of projects slowing down as company gets bigger (more politics, processes to follow, etc.) Growth, promotions, and challenges also slowing down as company grows</p> review1224: The entrance exam was very difficult and there were alot of background checks undertaken before the job was actually started. This made for a very stressful first impression but quickly got better as the process progressed.</p> review1225: Those coming straight out of college, note that having Google on your resume is fantastic, but this role may not be ideal for you if you&#039;re not interested in Sales. It requires a lot of cold-calling and internal movement may be harder than you expect.</p> review1225: Speed of execution results in acceptance of short attention spans</p> review1226: I don&#039;t actually feel like the smartest person in the room while im there. its odd for some people (ie me) to adapt to. lol.</p> review1227: Constantly working, not a great work life balance.</p> review1228: No as such, Very good organisation</p> review1229: It&#039;s a corporation, so there are definitely some predictable minuses that come with that: it&#039;s not as nimble as a start-up, there is some unavoidable bureaucracy, etc.</p> review1230: Depending on role, can be very narrowly focused at times.</p> review1231: long hours at a small office</p> review1232: people think they are better than others. Hard to get things done</p> review1233: Honestly, I can&#039;t see any major cons here in Google. As I mentioned above, it&#039;s very pleasant place to work in.</p> review1234: Because it&#039;s a big company, you have to retain your own &#034;Start-up&#034; drive and motivation. You could just drift along if you aren&#039;t proactive. But if you are proactive, wow can you get things done and go places. It just takes a little internal motivation.</p> review1234: - As my department grew they started having too many middle management (several &#039;directors&#039; in one team? really?) and it was not really clear why they&#039;re here. - Too many re-orgs just for re-orgs sake, or just to create some work for those managers. One team I worked with were bounced back and forth between 3 different departments within 2 years because of this.</p> review1235: Work-life balance can be tough, specifically in some of the central functions (my experience). I believe a lot of that issue stems from Google being able to attract the absolute best talent in the world who are expecting a fast &#034;startup-like&#034; career trajectory. That&#039;s simply not possible anymore given the size of the company, so political maneuvering and passive-aggressive face-time cultures have begun to emerge on some teams. A corollary to that is the feeling that change within Google often happens only for the sake of change (or because someone needs a platform to show &#034;impact&#034; and get promoted), not necessarily because it&#039;s needed. The company has the luxury of not really having to prioritize, so this type of thing isn&#039;t implicitly discouraged, but imagine what else Google could do if it did prioritize a bit more!</p> review1236: There can be an atmosphere of one-upsmanship sometimes, when egos come into play. There are a lot of strong egos at Google.</p> review1237: there are some pretty big egos</p> review1238: As Mountain View (HQ) continues to grow, you spend more time collaborating with others over video calls and IM, making it a more inefficient workflow</p> review1239: Not so super work timings I say</p> review1240: one of the big issues was the lack of flexibility. it is very difficult if almost impossible to get a few days off to travel ext..</p> review1241: As the company has gotten larger (been there since 2007) politics has become more prevalent, especially over &#034;control of binaries&#034;. Why build on shared platforms when you can&#039;t control it (I think it is silly). As you move up the ranks, work life balance gets really screwy as you tend to work with offices all around the world (at least in my case).</p> review1242: I can&#039;t help but feel that I and everyone around me is overqualified for what we do. It&#039;s great that internal mobility has been easy for me in my years here, but not great that it sometimes is more about escaping boredom than it is finding new exciting challenges. A co-worker recently left after being here only a few months because he lost patience waiting to have been in his role long enough to be able to move to something else. Google also no longer offers full tuition reimbursement and instead just pays 2/3. I&#039;m glad I finished school before this policy went into effect. They&#039;ve made the process more complicated and have added more bureaucracy (additional bureaucracy seems to be a trend here).</p> review1243: They don&#039;t hire contractors for permanent positions, they pay very low</p> review1243: Good management can be spotty. The company has grown quickly which has led to some obvious middle management issues, with certain managers who are ill-equipped to take on a team of people and their work. Constant restarts - people leaving teams after the one-year mark means a new ideas coming in when the roles are replaced which can lead to a change in direction and strategy for a team and its individuals. Not to mention the knowledge loss when a member leaves the team. This happens A LOT.</p> review1244: hard to make your point across</p> review1245: Lots of underperforming long time employees and managers aren&#039;t courageous enough to fire them.</p> review1246: Some people can make you feel dumb.</p> review1247: Perhaps the only con is a result of the &#039;pro&#039; above. There are a lot of people who have only worked at Google and no where else since graduating from college. There is a lack of appreciation for how lucky we all are.</p> review1248: People are getting less Googley over the years.</p> review1249: Be careful being laid off by some reasons you don&#039;t know.</p> review1250: No matter what position you&#039;re in, coding is key. If you do develop skill in at least one programming language, there are limited opportunities.</p> review1251: Based on the team that you are on, it may be difficult to see the impact that you are having on the billions that use Google. That motivation has to come from yourself.</p> review1252: It&#039;s hard to stop working sometimes!</p> review1252: The Company is too big for you to know what each team is working on</p> review1253: lot of people hard to spend time on one project</p> review1254: hard to make a real impact, difficult to grow professionally</p> review1255: Cannot think of any.</p> review1256: Hard to get high impact work approved and done. Sometimes too much re-org and too little long term vision could hurt an organization with substantial size. Mid-management usually is the weak link in the system to constraint innovation, vision and productivity. Promotion system is kind of broken - we have managers/senior people in the team who made bad decisions about product but still got promoted at the exact the same time when the project was canceled - this just confused everybody about whether promotion has anything todo with people&#039;s work.</p> review1257: Growth bottleneck exists, the whole FLAT organization was not really true sometimes rapid change can be a bit overkill, it is a bit extreme in my taste</p> review1258: It&#039;s easy to feel intimidated by the talent surrounding you.</p> review1259: Way way way too metrics driven.</p> review1260: After all the interviews, they have nothing to offer you other than status for your resume.</p> review1261: There are few &#034;cons&#034; to Google. One possible thing that can be mentioned here is that Google is a very large company, and it is somewhat easy to find a corner in which to lose oneself. Another possible knock is that Google has a small number of allowed languages. If you want to code in languages other than C++, Java, Go or Python, you&#039;ll probably not have much support at Google.</p> review1261: As hard as they work at cutting through bureaucracy, it remains a large company with all the problems that gives. If you&#039;re the kind of person that likes to just get things done instead of guiding your project through the companies processes, you may get frustrated.</p> review1262: People are really pretentious. Company is too big now, you&#039;re not contributing much</p> review1263: I don&#039;t think there are any cons.</p> review1264: You will get burned out eventually which is why the majority of the employees don&#039;t last more than 3 years. You are expected to work day and night, no matter what role you&#039;re in, and be available when away on vacations. Management will stress over and over that they wan you to check out for PTO, but when you do, it backfires and I&#039;ve had 9 different managers and all were the same. I believe it comes from the culture that you must work 24 hours a day. Majority of the staff is young, and they love to hire right out of college because it keeps fresh ideas but also because they can suck more time out you. The peers you work with are not friendly, competitive to the extreme, and will throw you under the bus during review cycles so their performance review will give them a 1-up during calibrations and promotions. Also, don&#039;t expect to get promoted often, if at all. Also, if you don&#039;t like company re-orgs then this isn&#039;t the place for you. I t&#039;s expected your job responsibilities will change regularly, as often as they re-org themselves.</p> review1265: The company does not place a lot of value on Temporary Vendor Contractors. They are seen as disposable employees with no room to grow.</p> review1266: -In most orgs there&#039;s a glass ceiling for non MBAs. There&#039;s too much emphasis on pedigree vs real-world experience. -A serious sense of entitlement/hubris exists throughout, most prevalent on campus where recent college grads operate in a non-reality.</p> review1267: In the sales org, a few things to be wary of: a) the culture has gotten overly political and b) aggressive. I think this starts with Nikesh and works its way through the org</p> review1268: promotions, decision making process, office culture</p> review1269: Slowly becoming a big company, bit of red tape everywhere.</p> review1270: Lack of opportunities for growth, especially if you&#039;re not an engineer in a distributed office.</p> review1270: Management of the department could have been stronger, clearer direction, more transparent, rewarding based more so on merit.</p> review1271: Difficult to get good work noticed. Everyone is very smart there of course, and so it isn&#039;t always easy to get your work shown at the highest levels.</p> review1272: None. You just have to be very proactive about advancing your career which I actually enjoy</p> review1273: Google opened the Kirkland office to poach from Microsoft and Amazon. Looks like they got what they wished for. The office and Google internally is just brimming with politics and useless processes now. All the good Engineers have/will leave very shortly.</p> review1274: Lot of work. There is no balance at times. People are doing useless work that is beneath their capabilities. However, it is up to you to find out what you can do to contribute to the project.</p> review1275: Career Growth, Appreciates only launches.</p> review1276: The hours can be very long. Google has a strong Not Invented Here mentality. So you will work with a lot of Google-only code. Everything from the development environment, build system, code review tool, automated test tool are in house only tools. They are all custom developed.</p> review1277: Work-life balance can be a bit difficult because of the pressure from executives outside our team; however, leads work to be role models of work-life balance in order to encourage associates to manage their schedules as necessary to protect personal happiness.</p> review1278: There&#039;s a lot going on and sometimes work/life balance suffers.</p> review1279: Leadership with ADD, constant change of direction/priorities, reorgs, churn, turnover, duplication of effort, lack of accountability, chaos, etc. that sometimes leads to inferior results, unfinished work, unequal treatment, and burnout. In some offices, overcrowding and poor physical conditions.</p> review1279: If you live in SF and work in MTV the commute is long. Otherwise there are very few cons to working at Google. They&#039;ve created an incredible corporate environment.</p> review1280: Nothing, I love it. Nothing else to say.</p> review1281: - Manager quality varies immensely from very strong to very weak; bad managers are not dinged if their team delivers strong results (even if Google bleeds talent as a result) - Ability to hire pretty much anyone means that there is a surplus of overqualified, underutilized people; as a result, the workforce has a LOT of unmotivated talent staying for the cushy gig (high compensation, good work-life balance) - Non-engineers are second-class citizens</p> review1282: It&#039;s gotten big. People who have dreams of working at startups will find out that Google is now (and has been for a while) a very large company with lots of divisions and layers.</p> review1283: The usual things you run into with a large company, nothing to be super worried about.</p> review1284: Security badges and TVCs are second class employees</p> review1285: Success/Recognition != necc translate to comp and promotions. Politics is very real. There are some really bad VPs who need to be avoided.</p> review1286: Upward mobility within the sales organization is difficult, particularly if you aren&#039;t keen on organizational politics. It&#039;s very separate from the rest of the Google and has the feel/culture of a consulting firm rather than an org trying to work on challenging and interesting problems. It&#039;s so far removed from the business, they&#039;ve actually moved sales to a completely new campus they built. It literally feels like two companies. For working at a company with such lofty and ambitious goals, it can be annoying to hear people cite free food as a huge perk; and often times, it can make someone who is looking for something more out of life question the culture. That being said, the free food is quite wonderful ;)</p> review1287: good training, good benefits, acceptable working hours,</p> review1288: You can get complacent. Climbing the ladder is becoming tougher and tougher. Expect a title downgrade if you come here laterally. Fair amount of bureaucracy, though not crippling given the size.</p> review1288: It is a big place and it is easy to feel at the bottom of the pile</p> review1289: • Very competitive and difficult to make career progression • Everyone is overqualified for their jobs. Because everyone wants to work at Google, they can get by hiring candidates with 5+ experience for positions other companies consider entry level.</p> review1290: As Google grows larger more process and bureaucracy set in. Unfortunately the highly selective hiring process has a high false negative rate.</p> review1291: long working hours; feel like a minor part in the big picture; new team opportunity is taken before posted for public knowledge.</p> review1292: More and more narrow work, increasingly bureaucratic</p> review1293: Nothing comes to mind really.</p> review1294: they do their best, there aren&#039;t many cons I can think of.</p> review1295: Too much talent in one place</p> review1296: None. Really have nothing negative to say.</p> review1297: As the company has grown very fast, some of the processes are still designed for a small company and it is frustrating to make them work for a large corporation In some circumstances, politics start to sneak in</p> review1297: Bureaucracy is a big problem</p> review1298: It&#039;s really big and thus you have to do a lot of internal &#034;selling&#034; to move ideas forward. Once you have sufficient buy-in, Google can move quickly, but it can take a long time to get there. Although you generally have really nice colleagues, that doesn&#039;t always mean everyone is incredibly smart (IQ + EQ) - that&#039;s the price you pay for fast hiring in a big firm.</p> review1299: 1. Work/life balance is non-existent 2. The recruiting organization is very metrics driven 3. Very political You&#039;re expected to hire an ungodly amount of people AND work on high profile projects or your quarterly performance review could be in jeopardy. The keyword is &#034;high profile.&#034; Unfortunately they don&#039;t often tell you if the project you&#039;re working on is high profile enough until it&#039;s too late. Keep in mind that sometimes your projects carry more weight than your core job. On the political side, friends of managers were promoted (so were their significant others) ahead of people many thought were far more qualified. One case was so blatant that I wondered why no one said anything. Very senior management did a good job of conveying the overall message but many middle managers were incompetent. One former manager frequently brought coworkers to tears. One new manager told me shuttle time wasn&#039;t work time. When I explained I had  to work on the shuttle so I could make it on time to pick up my daughter from daycare at 6:30 PM, I was told &#034;not my problem.&#034; Keep in mind I was working 9-10 hours a day from the time the shuttle picked me up in the morning to the time it dropped me off at night. Yet I was dinged for not being at my desk for that long because I couldn&#039;t be micromanaged. If you live very close to campus or work/life balance isn&#039;t something you&#039;re terribly concerned with, then you should be just fine.</p> review1300: The Benefits could be increased around insurance</p> review1301: It&#039;s a big company. There&#039;s red tape.</p> review1302: Sometimes hubris can be a problem - people assume that of course what we do will be the best, because we&#039;re Google.</p> review1303: Easy to get lost in the crowd. So many extraordinary people surrounding can sometimes be overwhelming and get to your nerves. But the company has become so big that nobody would care if you just came to work to eat, gossip and take your paycheck.</p> review1304: Great minds think alike, and working amongst so many great minds sometimes it becomes a challenge deciding whose idea is the best.</p> review1305: too much push and stress.</p> review1306: Silicon Valley goes though a major housing crisis. If you don&#039;t make $400k/yr. you shouldn&#039;t be here.</p> review1306: The working environment is very competitive. It is a big company for starters. Work life balance could be better.</p> review1307: arrogant people, not product focussed</p> review1308: Getting to feel very big.</p> review1309: no so much bad things about this company</p> review1310: It&#039;s a big company which means opportunities for advancement require a lot patience, and it&#039;s actually slow to get things done internally as there are a lot of processes, may be becoming more complacent as the company&#039;s now a decade old</p> review1311: the perks can also find you always working late hours!</p> review1312: Google has an enormous number of divisions, and I can only speak to the one I ended up in - YMMV. My work area was a warehouse with open ceilings, concrete floors, and metal desks arranged in groups of six people in a workspace. The interview process was generic, so that once you are approved, you go into a pool of candidates from which managers pick new hires. I only had a half-hour phone interview with my future boss before I had to decide whether to take the position. My boss never allowed me to work with anyone on a project to get me up to speed, despite numerous requests for help. He assigned me the task of writing the specs for a major modification which included several groups not in my area - a task I would not expect of anyone with less than two years experience in the division, yet he assigned it to a person with less than four months experience. HR won&#039;t let you change groups until you have completed a year in your first position, so no allowance f or bad fits is made.</p> review1313: Google&#039;s tech stack is big and complex. You will be spending a lot of time figuring out how to plug together various systems and APIs. You may be spending a lot of time looking at various status pages, trying to understand whether your tasks are doing what they should with acceptable performance and why not and which obscure configuration option you need to tweak to make them. A lot of what you will need to learn to do the job will be specific operational knowledge about how to work that unwieldy beast that is Google&#039;s infrastructure. The code complexity is considerable, which means that implementing simple features can take much more time than you&#039;d think it should. It also means it can take a lot of time to get to the point when you feel like you at least somewhat know what you&#039;re doing. The company keeps the copyright to all your hobby projects. They have a system through which you can ask that the copyright be released to you on a case-by-c ase basis. Sometimes they&#039;ll say yes sometimes they&#039;ll say no.</p> review1314: I came in under an acquisition, excited to take on a new role! I found the acquisition team to be unprepared and without answers. My team members were confused about who even their new managers would be. While no one expected handouts, it was hard to find someone even interested in assisting those who came on with temporary roles. It was starting from scratch to find a place in the big Google world.</p> review1315: Huge company, somewhat bureaucratic</p> review1315: Mandatory code reviews create a government like culture where people can &#034;filibuster&#034; something they don&#039;t like by just whining and refusing to approve the contribution until the author gives in. There is a lack of a single person or team who is responsible for an overall priorities and schedule of a given project. Separate control of various aspects, like feature, UI and code can stunt timely progress of a product. You have to be competent and self-confident to comfortably work with competent and often hard-headed people. Interview process is capricious and often rejects well-qualified and valuable people for irrational reasons, like &#034;staying at the previous company too long&#034;.</p> review1316: getting too large and in the rat race.</p> review1317: different treatment for contractors (tvcs)</p> review1318: company is a bit too big these years, not as agile as it used to be.</p> review1319: Really big company-- hard to stand out Movement within company is horizontal more than vertical</p> review1320: There is very little emphasis on customers. the majority of folks who work here are motivated by two things: better resume, and tech stuff that one ups other techies. As a rather high ranking techie from half way across the world, these folks are not at all what I expected in terms of caliber. Communication, people management, keeping a cool head, these things are not common here, and if you have them, they are not appreciated here. This place is a mecca for folks that can&#039;t relate to others very well, but are very technically savvy. Before you come here there are a few things you need to know: 1) most folks come here because they want to be happy 2) aside from the common knowledge that if you are presently at (be careful of used to work at) Google then you are technically smarter than others 3) Once you leave Google, people will think it was because you couldn&#039;t cut it, not because you were amazing. the only way to go is to either A) start your own comp any (not very common as there is not a focus on customers) B) get poached (very common), but after you have been poached everyone will still think you couldn&#039;t cut it at the big Goog. 4) most folks are happy because of 3 things: A) finding a mate (not very likely at Goog, unless you are hetero female, then game on, except most females here intimidate the guys... lol) B) making money (yep, you can do that here as well, ironically they don&#039;t pay that well for the area: IE you can 3x that in IT Finance or startups, or 2X in places like netflix; not to promote netflix, but they are very interesting if you are heavily motivated by the mulah) C) making a difference in the world (not super common here) I know a lot of people who are only happy when talking to other people about their career because they work at Goog, but have pretty much put their life on hold, and their happiness on hold to be here. Honestly, only work here if you live here. Do not travel to work at Goog le. It doesn&#039;t work out, and everyone ends up leaving to find a mate, more money, Do not move away from family to be here. Basically work here if you have no other options. If your people skills or business skills are to weak to affect folks, and you are OK not finding anyone special for a few years, and you are OK with really long hours, work here. It is hella good bragging rights to most folks, but once you get high enough in the tech world, it can be a negative. Actually I should share this as well. the best people at google get poached (startups, other tech companies, etc...) the worst get canned all the people who can fake it stay the people that stay hire other people just like them There are a sea of shitty people growing at Google, beware them, and if one of them is your manager, transfer or leave ASAP, lest you find out the #1 factor of job unhappiness. =) All in all, if you live in the area, and are just starting your career, please dont let this scare you. Th is is a great place if you are local, young (22-28), and not interested in finding a mate. GL out there!</p> review1321: I cannot think of any whatsoever. This company is superlative in every way. If I absolutely had to come up with a con, I would say that the worst part of working at Google is the innate guilt I experience when others talk about their jobs and then ask about mine. It is hard to have to explain to others how amazing a workplace Google provides, and to witness the incredulous looks others give. (To explain why I am no longer working at Google - I simply left for another opportunity in a different area that Google does have, but I would love to one day return.)</p> review1322: I felt that moving around involved a lot of politics. I always felt like my manager was trying to keep me and others from moving up on the chain. This was very horrible. After I got a new lead, it was a little better, but my time there was limited as I had already put in my 2 weeks notice just before I got my new lead.</p> review1323: New features need to ensure privacy of the user data is preserved to finest detail thus requiring great engineering effort to build something substantial.</p> review1324: Managers don&#039;t seem to be incentivized to help you advance your career. The promotion process is the biggest pain you can imagine, and completely self-propelled. If you&#039;re not the type that likes to promote yourself, you&#039;ll be stuck at the bottom for a long time.</p> review1324: Lots of energy and time wasted on politics. More people than the work needed.</p> review1325: There are not enough trees in the offices and the fish tanks get dirty sometimes.</p> review1326: There are many projects that get rejected or shutdown because they aren&#039;t Google-scale. Any of these projects that gets rejected would be really successful if it was created by a startup. This also means that the bar for launch is much higher. Google is no longer a startup. It is hard to move fast. We try to balance creating innovative products and a consistent user experience that makes it hard to move quickly as you end up spending a lot of time trying to integrate into existing products. You are working with incredibly intelligent and incredibly ambitious people. This makes the environment a bit competitive and people focused on what gets them ahead.</p> review1327: - too many smart people, hard to stand out - some buildings are overly crowded and noisy; hard to concentrate - easy to get fact with so many free food</p> review1328: Far from san francisco and, event with the shuttles, the commute is hard !</p> review1329: You constantly need to be up to date on the latest in ecommerce.</p> review1330: Can be difficult to switch projects. Some of the work can be boring. Engineering-wise, it&#039;s hard to experiment publicly -- too many eyes watching, too much need to scale. Can be hard to get good performance feedback until it&#039;s too late.</p> review1331: The company is huge, there&#039;s no denying it. Larry and his team do a great job of keeping things nimble and making the company feel much smaller than it is, but no one can say it feels like a small company anymore. In a company filled with hard workers and overachievers, it&#039;s easy to get too caught up on pay, the performance review process, and getting promoted. This is one reason why maintaining a good work-life balance can be challenging. And as open and egalitarian as Google tries to be, their compensation system is very opaque, which creates an information asymmetry between employer and employee. (Not different from most places, it&#039;s just that Google makes itself out to be open, but this is one area where they are not.) Some product groups value excellence and quality more than others, but that&#039;s probably true anywhere.</p> review1332: Can be hard to move up quickly and often competitive even for internal transfers Lots of really intense type-A individuals, so it can be easy to get caught up in that perfectionist atmosphere HUGE. Just so many people.</p> review1333: Google can be very secretive when releasing new products.</p> review1333: Sometimes I get too wrapped up in my work and neglect other duties, such as going home, but the college-like atmosphere is really great for allowing you to focus on your project and get work done!</p> review1334: High expectation to achieve. Sometimes what they say the company&#039;s values are and what is actually applied don&#039;t completely match.</p> review1335: extremely challenging. peer pressure to always keep building amazing stuff 24 * 7. Too much technology to update yourself with.</p> review1336: - new areas could be ambiguous - some coworkers may not understand the challenges of work life balance with kids even though policy is in place</p> review1337: Free time leaves lots of options for playing minesweeper</p> review1338: You can go elsewhere to get paid more doing the same thing.</p> review1339: None. The place is awesome. No cons to report at this time</p> review1340: If you&#039;re not good at self-promotion or awkward in large groups, it can be easy to get lost in the crowd.</p> review1341: under-par life and work balance politics growing by day</p> review1342: - Bureaucracy - Internal systems in constant beta stage - Micromanagement (on Sales) - Little tolerance to failure (on Sales) - Very bad work/life balance (no chance to work from home)</p> review1342: As the company gets larger, it is increasingly difficult to make a difference in the company.</p> review1343: Getting quite large, tends to make decision making opaque.</p> review1344: - Being clever sometimes slow you down - Priorities between teams are not always on the same page</p> review1345: Commute is terrible if you live in San Francisco and work in Mountain View. May be less fun and rewarding if you aren&#039;t on an interesting team/product. In a huge company, some people find they have difficulty feeling like they&#039;re making an impact.</p> review1346: Somehow may be hard to promotion</p> review1347: Poor middle management, inexperience and arrogance made life very difficult. Too much time playing and not enough time delivering. Academic prejudice runs deep, politics and back-stabbing is the norm.</p> review1348: Lots of other smart people makes it hard to progress</p> review1349: Big company. There are a lot of people who work here and it&#039;s easy to get lost in that.</p> review1350: Can be difficult to get your ideas into a product.</p> review1351: Too large, too competitive.</p> review1351: No cons as of now</p> review1352: Promotions in the Ad Ops team were hard to come by. Incredibly competitive, had to outshine your neighbor and be your own PR person. Lots of BS and busy work. No sense of contributing anything valuable to your team. Micromanagement and ever stringent review process - bar is always being raised.</p> review1353: A bit hierachical at times.</p> review1354: there are no cons at all</p> review1355: PMs own you and they can tell you what to do - you&#039;re basically working for them</p> review1356: My department had a confusing and constantly changing management structure.</p> review1357: Working in the legal department without a JD creates a glass ceiling in upward mobility (as can be expected from working in any legal environment without a JD)</p> review1358: The work you do has varying levels of impact and again, depending on your role, the chance that your work will change is minimal. You are essentially a cog in the big Google machine. Don&#039;t kid yourself into thinking that this is a startup-y kind of place, it&#039;s not.</p> review1359: Career growth/promotions are hard, workcoholic colleagues, work-life balance is difficult</p> review1360: There are so many talented people, there is a huge backlog for promotions and challenging assignments. At this point, most people are overpaid for what they do, so there is not a lot of attrition, making the backlog longer. It is easy to have a large absolute impact at Google, but the company is so big and successful it is hard to have much relative impact. Even delivering on a $1B business is a drop in the bucket for Google.</p> review1360: I don&#039;t have any big cons.</p> review1361: Big company so it takes time to know who&#039;s doing what. Difficult to be the best of the best in a place that&#039;s full of great talent.</p> review1362: Not exactly a con, but Google still operates in a start-up pace, even after 15 years since foundation.</p> review1363: Super hierarchical structure, not a meritocracy. At the end of the day, you&#039;re just a cog in a big money-making machine, so your work will be not that interesting. There&#039;s a ton of bureaucracy to deal with as well.</p> review1364: It&#039;s a temp job so that&#039;s the downside.</p> review1365: Can sometimes have the &#034;big company&#034; feel where you&#039;re individual impact can seem overshadowed.</p> review1366: The expectations to do great things is difficult for a career person who happens to have a family with you children. Time management is a must.</p> review1367: -certain roles can be monotonous -company is huge so naturally there is some red tape (they are very cognizant of this and always trying to improve)</p> review1368: Very much a &#034;drink the Koolaid&#034; culture. There are some days where I just did not feeling like acting &#034;googly.&#034;</p> review1369: long distance to the customer</p> review1369: If you get stuck with a bad manager, in a chain of people who aim to protect that person, good luck. Low base salary. Very hard to advance. Some groups can be very political.</p> review1370: High goals create high pressure.</p> review1371: Big organization without long term goals. Chaos in some teams but not all Managers don&#039;t take decisions</p> review1372: Some positions to not allow for much growth or promotion unless you were a manager before coming to Google.</p> review1373: Located in Mountain Spew, not close to public transit, bikes are embarrassing to ride.</p> review1374: Can&#039;t really think of any. Just had great perks and amazing people and experiences. Learned from lots of professional people and got great benefits.</p> review1375: Low visibility in your team.</p> review1376: You won&#039;t have a WhatsApp level payout day.</p> review1377: Everything is wonderful at Google</p> review1378: Making the transition from a start up to Google was incredibly challenging. Since our product was being moved to the &#034;stack,&#034; we had no updates and lost our competitive edge. This made it difficult for our sales teams to succeed, thus eliminating a number of roles.</p> review1378: Sneaking into company events. Explaining that you&#039;re not with adwords but you actually have a meaningful project. The general disdain most googlers have for the adwords crowd. No job security, low pay, low respect. For contractors. If you want to try to get a full time job here, don&#039;t have other plans for a year. AT ALL.</p> review1379: I cannot think of any cons of working at Google beside the fact that I am not allowed to tell anyone what I do, where I do it, or how long I&#039;ll be doing it for. haha</p> review1380: Nothing new coming up that will take on the market like search did.</p> review1381: Campus is too big need to walk so far. Too many cafes to choose from. Too many buildings to visit.</p> review1382: Takes a lot of time to make an app with this software!?!</p> review1383: Start up life might wear you down</p> review1384: I&#039;d argue that there aren&#039;t any cons</p> review1385: Very little structure, wasteful money, over hire people that are not needed.</p> review1386: It may be tough at times, as you are competing with very smart people. It feels humbling from time to time!</p> review1387: very difficult to advance in the company cult-like</p> review1387: No ownership of work, unclear career trajectories, hard to have impact (small fish in big pond syndrome)</p> review1388: The only con I would site is that it&#039;s a highly competitive place, which is to be expected at a company full of Type A personalities.</p> review1389: Increasing demand to achieve results is taking stress to uncomfortable levels, and some managers are having a hard time handling it. Difficult to move to a role out of your area of expertise.</p> review1390: Highly competitive. Ramp up takes a long time. Promotions are a little bit hard to get.</p> review1391: You must throw your team mates under the bus to get ahead.</p> review1392: Too big already, not a startup feel</p> review1393: Competition can make the work tough</p> review1394: there are really no cons to working in Google. Although it can be tiring at times.</p> review1395: Arrogant employees, better than thou, work you to exhaustion and are never honest about performance</p> review1396: unclear paths to advancement; Goals not always articulated; numerous different managers a different one every 6 months; can feel &#034;cultish&#034; though it would classify as a nice cult</p> review1396: No telecommuting - pretty much the rule. Some peer reviews can be nasty as people are indexed against each other. Management is always given stretch goals.</p> review1397: i cannot think about downsides</p> review1398: Very cult like, uncomfortable if you don&#039;t want to buy in.</p> review1399: Entry-level support positions have little job mobility and lack the glamour of other Google departments</p> review1400: No cons. Company is great to work for</p> review1401: Google&#039;s gotten big. Very big. With human nature the way it is, the size leads to the challenges you&#039;d expect -- silos, difficulty coordinating, diffusion of responsibility, culture, etc. Everyone has to fight against these natural tendencies every day, and it doesn&#039;t come easy. To me, this is the #1 reason why people find it hard to work here. It&#039;s a real problem. It can make simple things seem impossible, it can cause arguments, it can seem chafing or even suffocating, and even when people consciously fight these issues, it&#039;s not always handled in the best way.</p> review1402: No Ladder growth, many misuse WFH option</p> review1403: As with all companies, sometimes there are issues with managers and coworkers, but we are all adults and know how to deal with such conflict.</p> review1404: Some people don&#039;t have a life outside of work and have similar expectations of those around them. Management works to avoid bureaucracy, but as the company grows it&#039;s hard to avoid. The rapid pace of hiring has definitely changed the feel of the company.</p> review1405: - the work is not always stimulating or consequential</p> review1405: 1. Too much peer pressure. 2. Everybody is smart here. Especially some smart no social skill guys really can drive you insane. 3. Things change very fast, you have to keep learning no matter how fast learner you are.</p> review1406: i see no cons, everything is simple just like the website. everything is just perfect, even the food.</p> review1407: Career progression is a key problem at Google. As the company is so young, so many of the initial employees are still working there, which leaves very little opportunity for new hires to climb the ladder</p> review1408: The culture can be a little inward-looking IMO, also many employees are unprofessional and/or rude on internal communication channels. The company (and internet advertising in general) seems to get a bad rap from external parties this days, which I believe is undeserved. We seem to do a bad job controlling perception of the Google brand.</p> review1409: Working on systems where 98% of it is optimized and you are looking for the 2% efficiency improvement.</p> review1410: The amazing benefits and incredibly stimulating work environment makes it difficult to leave.</p> review1411: Massively large scale means slower development</p> review1412: I worked at Google for over 6 years and saw a lot of growth during this period. The resulting bureaucracy could be frustrating and certain decisions were nearly impossible to reverse; I often heard statements to the effect of &#034;we analyzed this a few years ago and our decision was X, so we&#039;re not going to revisit it now.&#034;</p> review1413: Not enough interesting work. Kind of boring. Google is lacking on innovation.</p> review1414: - Politics and bureaucracy were creeping in by 2009 which made life as a middle manager difficult - Long hiring process made it difficult to build up your team</p> review1414: very intimidating-- you&#039;re surrounded by some of the smartest people</p> review1415: Relatively slow to get promoted compared to small-sized companies.</p> review1416: As the company gets bigger the management is becoming more top-down, resulting in a lot of products or teams not getting enough internal traction to make impact.</p> review1417: Long hours -- people check and send email at all hours of the day!</p> review1418: The company had long hours</p> review1419: It has a Fast paced environment.</p> review1420: - pressure to meet data-driven goals sometimes leads to the work feeling a bit redundant. - hanging out with engineers all day, every day, makes for interesting (a)social interaction</p> review1421: paid less because consultant very part time</p> review1422: Having come over as a junior member on the support team, I was constantly reminded by other teammates that they had worked at Google longer and, therefore, I didn&#039;t matter as much. I was astounded by the superiority complex numerous full-time &#034;Googlers&#034; had toward the temps, vendors, and contractors Google also employs. This attitude also was exhibited toward employees who came to Google via acquisitions. Google likes to stress the point of working on personal initiatives and projects. This unknowingly resulted in the duplication of efforts between locations. If it was discovered that a person in another location was working on a similar project, there was usually a meeting to compare initiatives. If the projects were similar and your peers had seniority over you, you were forced to stop your work even after having invested months on it. At other times co-workers actively stole project plans and claimed as their own. On another occasion, one of my p ersonal projects was &#034;taken over&#034; by a manager who thought my project would benefit their current initiative. I was forced to stop work on my project as it had been transitioned to the manager&#039;s team. That said, many of the people are actually quite wonderful. Just keep in mind that as Google grows, there are less ways to be noticed and moving up is more difficult which means many people will try to get ahead any way they can.</p> review1423: * Work-life balance isn&#039;t good. * Can be very stressful at times. * Doing too many things, which detract from the quality of products and dwindle resources</p> review1423: Getting too bureaucratic and losing original vision</p> review1424: The salary is less than you can get at similar companies. If you don&#039;t care about or take advantage of the perks, its especially obvious.</p> review1425: Long hours, employee evaluation system is based on a bell curve, so even a rockstar team has employees &#034;below expectations&#034;.</p> review1426: Red-tape, red-tape, red-tape, inability to transition out of roles for Ops workers</p> review1427: There really aren&#039;t any. The commute maybe, depending on where you live? But that&#039;s goign to be a problem anywhere.</p> review1428: Hard to deal with being average, if you were a super-achiever in your old job (most of the not-great people were weeded at interview time, as well as many other good people).</p> review1429: Bureaucracy of a large company. Lots of scrutiny in the press on anything Google does.</p> review1430: There was a bit too nerdy atmosphere, and the company was too basically too big to get to know even what&#039;s going on in nearby teams.</p> review1431: make sure you can deal with ambiguity</p> review1432: Salary isn&#039;t the best on the market. Google knows it can pay less than it has to, because people want to work for it. Google has departments working on formulas meant to pay you as little as possible. Huge fight to get to the top - everyone is in a race. A culture of overachievers, which means you have to sacrifice personal and social life to move up the ranks. I&#039;ve seen amazing rates of burnout among marketing. Too much. Also, middle management can be incompetent or too busy racing to the top to care about you. Everything is in formulas, and just doing a great job is not enough. You need to shop yourself and shout about your achievements as loud as you can in order to get promoted. Also, the commute from the city sucks. Oh, and the company&#039;s product strategy is a laughing stock. Google jumps on every shiny object. It&#039;s one thing to reinvent an industry, but to launch clones is just low. Google+ is shoved down everyone&#039;s throat. Google Off ers was a Groupon clone. And nobody cares about the user, the company is totally evil. Decisions are made based on $$$, and not the user in mind. Don&#039;t be fooled.</p> review1432: - It is a large company, so the scale means development will be slower, albeit still proceeding at a much faster pace than at comparably sized company.</p> review1433: At least in my department - processes were not very streamlined and created inefficiencies and unnecessary work.</p> review1434: The company is huge and the bureaucracy has ballooned. It is very hard to get things done. The politics are awful. Many people in the org simply exist to promote themselves. My boss only focuses on how to make himself look good. Definitely a bit company that is still innovating but feeling like Microsoft more and more everyday.</p> review1435: always too much to do</p> review1436: Living expenses in the bay area</p> review1437: All things hinge on your manager and if they&#039;re not very good this will harm you.</p> review1438: work/life balance could be hard for some</p> review1439: Too much infrastructure to grapple initially</p> review1440: None as such which can be specified in particular as the industry is best place to work at in US and anywhere else in the world.</p> review1441: - As a very engineering centric company, not as many other resources go towards the supporting functions. Engineers have a clear career path, yet this can be difficult to navigate if you&#039;re in another role. However, there is much internal mobility. - Like any large company, Google is very hierarchical. It&#039;s who you know. - Priorities are constantly changing. - Can almost be a utopian society - People have golden handcuffs here. There are brilliant people who are doing jobs that they&#039;re not passionate about and that they&#039;re overqualified for. However, because of company brand and reputation, they perceive it to be worthwhile.</p> review1441: Office politics can sometimes suck.</p> review1442: Let&#039;s be honest: Google spoils it&#039;s employees. We&#039;re all fortunate to work here. The thing I worry about most is whether I&#039;m making a real difference. Google has such a legacy, and such infinite resources, that it can be a little overwhelming trying to figure out if you&#039;re taking full advantage of the opportunity. For example, I&#039;m guessing that the job posting that started my career here had maybe 100 other applicants. That&#039;s 100 people who could have done a better job if I feel like &#034;taking it easy&#034; today. I worry about doing well enough here to continue he legacy built before me.</p> review1443: strong bureaucracy, bad promotion system,</p> review1444: I have to work in the MTV office, even though I live in SF.</p> review1445: Allow 20% time to actually be used.</p> review1446: Organized Chaos is extremely difficult to navigate</p> review1447: That appeal fades over time, though, and it&#039;s very difficult to grow inside the company. You&#039;ll wonder what good is your Ivy League degree (or similar) in a place like Google where the company recruits and boasts the &#034;best and brightest&#034; simply because it can afford to. You&#039;re not able to put your hard work, talent, and aspiration to good use or to anything meaningful. Google is definitely not all that awesome for non-engineers.</p> review1448: No cons about the employer</p> review1449: All food made me fat</p> review1450: It has grown too big.</p> review1450: Well established, not much opportunities left. The way to evaluate ppl is obscure.</p> review1451: Largely mediocre middle management, mediocre projects for 99% of the company, and hierarchical</p> review1452: very rigid upper management structure and company policies. even if someone can do more, you&#039;re limited by your role, access, etc. as typical at large companies, departments are very compartmentalized and there&#039;s not too much cross-functional interaction. Google also tends to hire more based on credentials first, personality second, and experience third. I&#039;ve seen bright people who spend 8 hrs doing something that should take 1 hr due to being fresh out of school and lacking experience.</p> review1453: I never did go home to much it was a bit difficult to stand the amount of programmers that were not profesional at all.</p> review1454: Sometimes a bit fragmented in priorities and the pace can be challenging at times as it&#039;s pretty relentless</p> review1455: The growing speed of such organization might generate some management problems if not properly handled.</p> review1456: Stress from being over worked, long hours at times, some people don&#039;t work well with others, and meetings are aplenty.</p> review1457: The only downside for working at Google is being surrounded by delicious free food which i always want to eat. I&#039;ve gained some weight while working here but at least they have gyms to help you burn it off.</p> review1458: For the lawyer hired post IPO, the pay is low and the hours are long. I&#039;d prefer better compensation than all the perks - many of which I could not really use because I was working too hard. Things change frequently and working with some of the smartest people comes with a price, which is often a high level of arrogance - even disdain for lawyers. Maybe it&#039;s what keeps the Google business more successful. Aside from that, Google legal is now like a big law firm - that many lawyers. Lots of layers of management.</p> review1459: 1. Long working hours, no work-life balance. 2. If you work only for 40hours, you won&#039;t get promoted and you will be sacked.</p> review1459: --Unless you&#039;re above a certain level, it can be tough to move internally despite what any recruiter might say to you. --Google changes every day which is great from a product perspective but can be frustrating as an employee who wants to have a consistent manager.</p> review1460: No work life balance even though they talk about it a lot. 85% of my team were single, and they worked 70+ hours a week. If you wanted to put out the same amount of work, and meet the expectations of your manager you had to do the same.</p> review1461: Organization gets too big and gets hard to stay in cozy start up environment during 2005 when I first joined. Some managers are getting less qualified as they are from top MBA schools, too much strategy talks but no implementations, too political sometimes!</p> review1462: pay was not up to industry standards</p> review1463: Because there&#039;s always so much going on, many projects get cancelled or re-assigned, which means there can be some shuffling around. However, for me, this resolved with me moving into a much better position on a great team.</p> review1464: Discriminatory advancement (no women or pics in exec team)</p> review1465: Google lives to the hype in everything but transparency. The food is excellent and free, its fun, but your managers will not tell you if you need to move or if your not performing well. You can lose your job quickly if you aren&#039;t aware of what they think about you.</p> review1466: Too many overqualified employees are considered during performance reviews, making promotion difficult. Entry level pay is subpar compared to other huge technology companies. Management may be hard to budge when new ideas are presented.</p> review1467: Lots of smart people means a lot of people are underutilized.</p> review1468: Google is a big company now. It&#039;s not a startup and you won&#039;t be making $millions (but you will be comfortable). Sometimes management have product decisions that even most of Googlers do not approve.</p> review1468: It almost feels like a social club, good for some though</p> review1469: As Google is getting bigger it is getting more difficult to have your opinion heard and to move quickly within the organization. Promotions can be hard to come by and take much longer here than at other companies.</p> review1470: not that effective in innovation</p> review1471: Engineers rule. If you aren&#039;t one, you may feel slighted. Also, school snobbery may keep your department from being able to hire talented people, and force you to accept other candidates who are less desirable but went to a top tier schoo.</p> review1472: Long hours, Long Commute, Lots of programming</p> review1473: Google is a huge multinational corporation, so -- while they do make an admirable attempt at shielding individual employees from all the bureaucracy and inertia that entails -- those downsides are not entirely avoidable.</p> review1474: Similar problems to every big corporation</p> review1475: It *is* a big company now. I happened to start in 2007, when my team was small and scrappy, which was challenging, but super fun at the same time. The company is certainly much bigger now, and that fun, small, scrappy feeling is fading.</p> review1476: Sometimes management can be problematic but there is very little I can sat that&#039;s negative about Google. People who work here understand it.</p> review1477: Not really. It is too large sometimes feel lost.</p> review1477: most of the technology is inhouse, and google faces problems no one else does, so what you learn is non-transferable. Offices outside of Mountain View are treated very poorly.</p> review1478: i didnt have any to report</p> review1479: Hard to acquire breadth of knowledge if you haven&#039;t worked for a while. It&#039;s hard to learn how to &#034;do things&#034; that apply to outside of Google if you work at Google.</p> review1480: Interview was not that difficult, overall experience was great.</p> review1481: I have no complaints. I can&#039;t think of a single other company that I would want to work for. Great perks, great salary, great work, great team, great leadership.</p> review1482: Too much infusion of Apple culture</p> review1483: After being acquired, I went from being recognized for my contributions to being a number. Hated the review process and rating peers. Some peers would rate you and not have any direct contact with you. Didn&#039;t seem fair!</p> review1484: Compensation not strongly tied to performance.</p> review1485: - Commuting to the South Bay every day - Products continue to worsen, as design and usability take a backseat to quality - Android - Work/life balance was quite terrible</p> review1486: It has become really slow moving of late. It takes enormous amount of time for getting an idea implemented, which is kind of frustrating.</p> review1486: It&#039;s a large company now, sometimes not as nimble as smaller competitors. Also promotion is very challenging.</p> review1487: You have to fight for the good projects. Everyone around you is smart. (This is a good thing though.)</p> review1488: too much work, never stops. lots of weekends + nights</p> review1489: It&#039;s now a huge company.</p> review1490: Poor middle management Difficult to be heard Promotions and raises are rare</p> review1491: There&#039;s none i can think of</p> review1492: It&#039;s a big company now. It often takes a lot of effort to start new projects and there are plenty of distracting or disassociated programs. It&#039;s controlled, fast chaos at times.</p> review1493: + Not-as-smart peers if you are not lucky, and possibly less-exciting projects, too. In this case you need to pay your dues on that project for 12-18 months, before being able to transfer.</p> review1494: I&#039;m used to startup culture, and I had a serious culture shock coming to Google. Maybe it varies somewhat by team, but from my vantage point, engineering seemed very bloated and bureaucratic. There is an obscenely long and restrictive &#034;style guide&#034; of programming rules that must be followed and company-wide banned language features that makes coding much less productive than I&#039;m used to. Code reviews sometimes become bickerfests and can drag on for weeks or months. The allocation of engineers to teams is awful - my recruiter basically lied about what I would be working on, when I arrived I was assigned to a team and project that I had no interest in whatsoever, and there was nothing I could do about it except suck it up until I could leave. My coworkers were extremely risk-averse and were far more concerned about breaking something that already worked than about making progress. Also the culture is biased towards &#034;perfect&#034; engineering  solutions, and just hacking to get something done is highly frowned upon. This isn&#039;t always bad, and you can learn good programming practices and discipline, but unfortunately it just isn&#039;t always practical in the real world of deadlines and needing to make progress. The worst part of all is that I never felt like my work mattered anyway to the success of the company. I worked on various projects that my manager assigned (there wasn&#039;t much discretion in choosing things to work on, and the vaunted 20% time is just hype), and my manager had a lot of &#034;pet projects&#034; that he wanted done but didn&#039;t really have any great justification for why they should be done at all. Anyway Google is a big company and managers and teams vary in quality. I&#039;m sure there are plenty of people who are much happier than me, but I also think my situation is hardly unique.</p> review1495: Company gets bigger, more internal competition</p> review1495: Working with some very smart people can also turn into a bad thing because some smart people are real a** hole sometimes. Company is getting big and corporate. 20% project is available only when 100% is done. Performance review is still a mystery to me. I had gotten bad rating for working my butt off and good rating for not doing much.</p> review1496: too many people around the world.</p> review1497: processes tend to be heavy sometimes</p> review1498: There wasn&#039;t any cons for Google!</p> review1499: They have high expectations, and there is a lot of work. There is nothing else wrong about it besides what I have previously said.</p> review1500: The Con I generally have personally is that I have more awesome ideas than I have spare cycles to work on. There just isn&#039;t enough time in the day :)</p> review1501: 1 to many people 2 traffic is annoying</p> review1502: Hyperactive organisation can be exhausting.</p> review1503: Watch out your weight! You can gain your weight very easily due to too good food.</p> review1504: As Google grows, it is becoming a little more bureaucratic and harder to just do cool stuff.</p> review1504: Odd people at times (too nerdy/awkward).</p> review1505: Could handle employee acquisitions better.</p> review1506: There&#039;s a very deep org tree, and half of the people between you and the top are not managers first. There&#039;s also an annoying culture of entitlement, especially among some of the people who were recruited straight out of college and take the perks for granted, but it&#039;s easy to avoid.</p> review1507: - Too competitive - Parallel growth opportunities</p> review1508: As a long time Googler (more than 10 years), it pains me to write this, but it has gotten so bad that I feel compelled. Google used to be a place driven by a culture of collaboration, innovation, and, well, Googleyness. Unfortunately, this is no longer the case. The culture has descended into one where employees are pitted against each other by a rating system that forces managers to choose their best team members, no matter what. Got a team of all-stars? Too bad, some of them are still going to get bad reviews. Want everyone on your team to work together for a common goal? Sorry, everyone feels like they need to keep their best ideas protected because it’s survival of the fittest. As a result, I have seen great employees forced out, moral destroyed, and careers ruined as the system chews employees up and spits them out. It has taken me a long time to get to this place, as I forced myself for years to see the Google I once loved and not the Google that now exist s. It is all very sad. I know many ex-Googlers from the early days who despise what Google has become. It pains me to say that the company I once loved and admired has become what it says it never would be, evil.</p> review1509: company has gotten too big for a ton of growth opportunities, hard to leave bc spoiled by the benefits</p> review1510: Some managers are not entirely competent. Expectation is very high. Limited growth opportunities.</p> review1511: Big, hard to get things done.</p> review1512: One of the downsides during my employment at Google was the temporary nature of the project I was working on. I only wish that there was an opportunity for a permanent position on the project.</p> review1513: Not as such cons which i find</p> review1513: Nothing about Google is bad.</p> review1514: The coffee tastes terrible. Sometimes there aren&#039;t enough snacks.</p> review1515: Many egos at odds. Red tape and politics</p> review1516: No comment on this topic.</p> review1517: Sometimes it can be hard to get things done due to too many cooks in the kitchen</p> review1518: Has lost the start-up culture. It&#039;s big, it&#039;s political and it&#039;s expected. It&#039;s a gigantic company and compared to overall revenues and growth the company has managed to stay as &#034;un political&#034; as possible.</p> review1519: I doubt if the hiring bar is the same outside of engineering - specifically staffing. Most of the leadership have no idea about managing teams. For all the talk of Google being a metrics driven company...staffing seems ridiculously off - they talk in terms of numbers yes but most of the time the leadership barely even knows what targets staffing is chasing. Seniority is rarely rewarded and rather than giving opportunities to top performers for people to grow, politics &amp; smooth talking is rewarded. The problem with Google is that it lulls you into a comfort zone, so you keep doing your job which has decent compensation &amp; perks. But if you are looking to build a career- be prepared to navigate through the red tape &amp; much snubbing- unless of course you can smooth talk your way through. This is not a phenomenon exclusive to Google, though I have seen it to be much more prevalent at Google than elsewhere- mind you that I have worked with several larger glob al organizations in the past.</p> review1520: Many technologies are Google-specific, would not necessarily translate well to another employer.</p> review1521: I would have liked more opportunities to meet different people. In general I think it is a quiet office where people work a lot.</p> review1522: Google is a giant company with more structure and inertia than I expected. There is a lot of duplication of effort and it is really difficult to have a company wide impact.</p> review1522: Every thing is good enough</p> review1523: Self-induced pressure to &#034;keep up&#034; with the best of the engineers, a few &#034;difficult&#034; personalities.</p> review1524: HR is not as transparent as they say and switching between roles and getting promoted is not as easy as they claim.</p> review1525: Engineering is king so if you are working in some of the other departments, like HR/staffing, you may not feel as &#034;special&#034;. The conversion process to go from contractor to FTE is flawed and they string you out to the end of your contract. Ideal candidates are 2-3 years out of a top-tier university; staffing experience not required. Experienced recruiters and sourcers are better off going elsewhere as Google doesn&#039;t appear to value seasoned professionals.</p> review1526: The company has gotten to a size that it is very large. Lots of internal politics and incredibly difficult to elevate your career. Because of the size of the company, the process of quarterly evaluations and performance scores is incredibly competitive, cut throat and sadly...now fosters an environment of team mates meanly pitting themselves against each other. It&#039;s incredibly sad to see. You can bust your chops for years and have your score move up .1% The company is also very young, so if you&#039;re over 35 you&#039;ll be faced with a lot of Gen Y individuals who believe they deserve everything and it should be handed straight over to them. Management is also young so be ready for your boss to have much less experience than you do. It&#039;s great to have the company on your resume and people used to stay forever but the average turn over is now 2-3 years. Mobility between departments is also very difficulty (e.g. if you are in sales and want to move to pr oduct). Unless you are in NYC or Mountainview, you will never be considered.</p> review1527: Short-term contracts inevitably mean high turnover and high loss of tribal knowledge, although this was mitigated to some degree by reasonable training and team structure.</p> review1528: too big, hard to communicate sometime</p> review1529: Can&#039;t think about any. May be in future I&#039;ll update some.</p> review1530: I did not found yet.</p> review1531: Can be too big in number of employees</p> review1531: Don&#039;t let the sparkles blind you, the typical corporate bureaucracy is still alive within the company. Keep your eyes out and head up.</p> review1532: If you don&#039;t live close to an office, you can be superman and not stay on.</p> review1533: The company can sometimes seem inflexible, and not all parts of the company are as &#034;Googley&#034; as others. It&#039;s not easy to move around to different jobs or different divisions within the company - one must be very persistent to do so.</p> review1534: Amazingly smart people doing amazing mundane work with limited impact and contribution whilst being fattened up to potentially waste away a great career. Highly competitive atmosphere whereby much of the time creativity is sacrificed. Paraphrasing Page, &#034;We don&#039;t need people who can think of new and cool ideas. We have that already. What we need is people who can execute on the ideas we already have.&#034; Somehow the hiring process, great as it may be, ends up selecting for a disproportionate number of extremely egotistical a**holes. Low empathy Engineers that border on inhuman &#034;android&#034; like beings not too unfamiliar to those found in a Philip Dick novel where it is asked if they dream of electric sheep. Some do, most do not. But they do dream of self driving, all electric, BMW&#039;s. Restricted Areas: not all Google employees are treated equally around campus anymore and access is limited based on what you do for the company and what group  you work in. The culture is changing (see Restricted Areas): Google has hired roughly 8-10K people per year for the past ~4 years. I can&#039;t think of a company that has a better culture to hold on to but, from what I have seen, they are loosing the battle. Most managers and high potential employees look like they just stepped off the set of 90210.</p> review1535: dead locked in your own job. competitive.</p> review1536: It&#039;s a big company - sometimes it is unclear how the different initiatives fit together. Also, because it is an organization filled with smart, competitive people who like to be the best, there is a culture of overwork that is hard to fight.</p> review1537: Most of what you hear about working at Google is just hype. The reality doesn&#039;t live up to it. Shitty passive-aggressive middle management. Systematically rewards only short term results, which leads to exponential compounding of code cruft. I mean they give explicit instructions for calibration and promo to consider only demonstrable benefits of the last 6 months of work, and nothing earlier than that which had a delayed benefit. So the rank and file are forced to be like shitty mutual fund managers obsessed with quarterly results, in contrast to the upper management&#039;s supposed long term focus. When you start they flip a coin and if it comes up tails you are stuck in ads for years against your will. 20% time is a lie. 20% time is essentially unpaid overtime and if god forbid your 20% time takes a risk and fails you will be calibrated as if you had spent that time doing nothing. Every creative idea is shot down in favor of the same old safe but inefficie nt crap. All the projects come from the top down. There is no bottom-up innovation in ads because they try to keep everyone 110% busy with top down mandates. The company hasn&#039;t really innovated much in years. All their fast growing products are acquisitions or &#034;me too&#034; and the ads infrastructure is bloated and ossified. There&#039;s a lot of witness-tampering when it comes to peer reviews and stack ranks. You aren&#039;t allowed to rate your experience working with a person. You&#039;re supposed to somehow rate their entire accomplishment including stuff that you had nothing to do with. And if your stack ranks differ greatly from your manager&#039;s opinion of the latter they will passive aggressively hint that it will be a reason for firing you. Valve has a much better stack ranking system where people just rate their own experience working with a person and all feedback is anonymous. Also unlike Valve, Google has no freedom of association with whatever proje cts you want to do. It&#039;s all top-down mandates and selfish horse-trading by psychopathic middle managers. I&#039;ve read about the toxic culture that killed Microsoft and it sounds very similar to Google in my experience. A lot of the managers were hired from outside the company and tracked their shitty culture in with them. Perhaps that explains it.</p> review1538: Too many people that were not well rounded at all</p> review1539: A bit too big now, average managers</p> review1540: Tough to rise in the company</p> review1540: At its core Google is just selling ads, which is less glamorous and intellectually stimulating than the other business lines that receive more press.</p> review1541: Need to like change to be happy at G over the long term</p> review1542: Get spoiled, People consumed by the culture</p> review1543: Good luck taking advantage of the perks. I felt like I was sneaking out anytime I walked over to get a coffee or talk a quick walk around the building for a break. Expected to be at work from 8am to 11pm. Was reprimanded for talking advantage of amenities instead of working (an hour out of a 14 hour day)</p> review1544: -big, slow decision making, fewer job opportunities outside of HQ especially on exciting, new projects -not enough training, career development opportunities -promotions don&#039;t always reward most qualified</p> review1545: lacking organization in some teams. Some managers not well trained, promoted strictly on tenure, rather than skill or knowledge. limited advancement.</p> review1546: Not a lot of growth opportunity in the sales organization</p> review1547: Sometimes it&#039;s difficult for people who are used to being the &#034;big fish&#034; at their previous company to get used to the fact that they&#039;re aren&#039;t the leader of the pack anymore. Work/life balance at my old job was slightly better, but only because very few people had any passion for what they did so everyone was out the door as soon as they hit 40 hours and never answered email after hours.</p> review1548: It isn&#039;t as flexible as it used to be. Career advancement can be difficult if you aren&#039;t located in the Mountain View Campus.</p> review1549: Growth is pretty hard. Managers tend to micro manage and that is one of the few reasons I had left.</p> review1549: Google Boston does not get much interesting work</p> review1550: Way too many middle managers. Employees are mired in cycles of performance reviews, the dreaded calibration, being graded on the curve, etc. Competitive, political workplace.</p> review1551: When I was there, they hired record number of college grads. Not all of them were extraordinary. I couldn&#039;t help but wonder why they deserved the perks(investor money). Many of these people came from less diverse areas and had hard time understanding people of different cultures. They only hire smartest people, but even those need some sort of distinction among themselves. Talk about human ego. A team lead in my adjacent cubicle had created a small partition from rest of her team just to show her authority. Why would a smart person need that ? Wouldn&#039;t she distinguish herself by her leadership work ? Many people are trying very hard to prove that they are smart, and it shows. Google apparently is yet to come up with an algorithm to hire truly capable people in short time. Also their previous smart hires who have hired many smart people do not seem to be effective enough. Hence the ceremony of 10 rounds of interviews and hurting candidates&#039; self este em. Now that the party is over, only those who prefer to be in cushy jobs that pay well with perks they don&#039;t deserve are the ones left in this great company. Because the ones with real abilities whose life&#039;s pieces didn&#039;t fall in right places(like Steve Jobs) are out there trying to build something that&#039;ll shake up the status quo.</p> review1552: None till now. Companies like these have no cons.</p> review1553: Unforgiving if achievement isn&#039;t at a top level</p> review1554: Organization Google works in spite of being an unwieldy and oftentimes bureaucratic place. Reason: What it lacks in organization, it makes up for in the pure brain power of its employees. This is a good thing for the company, but can drive employees crazy when it comes to hacking through the weeds standing between you and pushing larger projects through to completion. Google needs to extend it&#039;s speedy product development mantra to the micro level of its individual internal workings. Work-Life Balance As a company, Google is actually pretty good about this. Many individual teams, however, focus on global dependencies, which both slows things down and result in a 24-hour-a-day need to be connected. Emails time-stamped 2am on a Saturday are commonplace. This oftentimes results in frazzled employees and work that isn&#039;t as solid or quickly produced as it could/should be.</p> review1555: over time. amazing culture, good company, compatible work environment and work flexibility. I have loved to work for my company so far. It is a superb company</p> review1556: very slow to get anything done; you work for your OKR&#039;s not for your passion. 20% time is a myth :(</p> review1557: Lack of ability to really do my job. A lot of waiting, boredom and red tape to do anything productive. Too many meetings.</p> review1558: - Employee counts exploding, not a &#034;start up&#034; anymore. - Lots of middle management now</p> review1558: Too big to move fast or do things the right way.</p> review1559: Bias towards the new, shiny, sexy projects often leaves Operations teams and other cost centers at a loss for resources and support. The basic conflict of interest between Ads Sales and Ads Quality/anti-fraud teams is a constant source of frustration.</p> review1560: Not much room to move up in the company.</p> review1561: The competition for the job is extremely intense. You will get some very tough interview questions, but as long as you get through those interviews you are okay</p> review1562: Not that I can think of, unless you are conscious with your weight cause the company feed you really good.</p> review1563: Job responsibilities doesn&#039;t allow room to grow fast.</p> review1564: They do not do many things without computers</p> review1565: Management Expectations for the tech staff</p> review1566: Difficult to move up in career ladder sometimes due to a middle managment bubble.</p> review1567: with limited career growth opportunities</p> review1567: Ratio of non-engineering to engineering employees not scalable to growth Lack of upper management support for needs of changing employee demographics and work/life balance</p> review1568: Competitive, job stability depending on department</p> review1569: + Some roles work with unpleasant content + For engineers if your product isn&#039;t the &#034;hot&#034; product, difficult to get additional resources</p> review1570: All movement is based on tenure.</p> review1571: too big company, hard to find good projects, boring</p> review1572: - Entertainment?? Really? ? There isn&#039;t any time to take advantage of all the Entertainment mentioned above unless you sacrifice your lunch break or one of the 15 minute morning &amp; afternoon breaks. Sacrifice resting after doing my job??? NO WAY!! See below- - With the amount of sweat and bodily exertion; when lunch comes around, it&#039;s all you can do in your 1 hour lunch to eat, drink, and down 2 more Gatorades to keep hydrated! I&#039;m in great shape, but the jobs performed by Operations Associates and Engineers such as myself, require extreme physical exertion in order to keep up. My hands are no longer hands, but machines in need of desperate repair. I have callouses so thick that I cannot feel my fingertips. My hands ache terribly each day and are so mangled it feels like I have an extreme case of rheumatoid arthritis or perhaps I do from all the manual labor! - HOT!! The Data Center is kept at a temperature so hot, about 30 minutes into working,  I am wanting to take a break to grab some Vitamin Water or any water for that matter. There are no water fountains and there is only one area which is typically far away in which employees are able to store water that must be in a CamelBack thermos. Every work area is extremely hot unless you&#039;re lucky enough to have a desk job. - Employees? It&#039;s interesting that the majority of actual work is done by workers who are not true Google employees. Temporary workers outnumber permanent Googlers by far. These individuals are interviewed for an entry level position by Google Management, but are actually employed by a Temp Agency. These poor saps are underpaid, overworked, and all are fighting for a permanent position that most will not obtain. They do the same work as many Operations Associates &amp; Engineers. But receive no promise for their hard work and are unappreciated by management. Management is not allowed to give temporary workers any type of feedback as to their  performance and are unable to pull them aside to tell them they are doing a good job, nor room for improvement.</p> review1573: None to speak of. The office culture and the pay are good, and the work is good too..</p> review1574: I can&#039;t thing of anything that would be considered as a con</p> review1575: Can be very stressful at times</p> review1576: hard to get in touch with senior management, limited options for growth, pretty strong hierarchy</p> review1576: The only downside is the long hours (at times).</p> review1577: Google is too huge that you will only be able to see a small small part of the whole company.</p> review1578: -commute (if you don&#039;t live in southbay) -ambiguous career path and grow -lots of product changes, unclear roadmap -big divide between eng and non-eng -more red tap, things take slower to get off ground</p> review1579: Google is a big company, so it&#039;s different from startup company. There will be process built that you need to follow and organization can be hierarchical. But it&#039;s nature of a big company. Still, there are some projects and teams in Google that act like startup.</p> review1580: Long hours and late nights due to everchanging digital media world</p> review1581: Everything else. The offices are placed in the cities. Horrible commute, non-stop parking troubles. The offices themselves are horrible, very densely packed. It&#039;s the only place I&#039;ve seen that has more densely packed offices than the banks. When you sign up, you don&#039;t get to know, what group you&#039;ll be assigned too. The job itself is incredibly stupid, you&#039;re guaranteed to be vastly overqualified for it. The smugness level is amazing, the smug is so thick you can cut it with a knife. There are worse places to work (i.e. banks) but for the technical companies it&#039;s a deeply substandard one. No wonder that the people who stay there for a long time are mostly the new grads, who haven&#039;t seen anything better.</p> review1582: big company: more bureaucratic, slow</p> review1583: It&#039;s difficult to stand out and be more than just a member on a team. Very noticeable if you were used to being a stand out in your previous job.</p> review1584: political, alot of processes, limited career opportunities, competitive coworkers</p> review1585: The interviews are really bad for the applicant: you learn nothing from what you will be doing and are interviewed only by people from completely different areas of expertise than yours. If you decide to come here, expect to have 5-6 layers of management above you. Unless your are a big shot or manage to get a strong ally, you often get the promise of leading some significant project, only to be exchanged without notice with more &#034;experienced&#034; people. Only a minority of engineers get to do the interesting stuff: Google+, Knowledge Graph, etc. If you are part of the other 99%, things are less exciting and the lower your rank is, the less freedom you have.</p> review1585: Hard to Promote, Job is not that challenging</p> review1586: Hiring process is not well organized. Need better explanation and coordination till interview process and followups.</p> review1587: Engineering teams alone seem to get more importance</p> review1588: No a clear structure on process or projects. Very hard to move up.</p> review1589: * Engineering has a free pass on everything except writing code. Some great engineers, but occasionally difficult to work with / lacking vision</p> review1590: Nothing to mention as of yet</p> review1591: Long hours, I work with a team overseas - and so my days can sometimes go from 5AM to 6-7, maybe 8 PM. It takes a long time to be promoted, due to having great people around you.</p> review1592: Those really smart people are also really competitive and because the perf process is only about personal impact, it discourages teamwork and real collaboration.</p> review1593: - Overworked - Management can be a nightmare to work with</p> review1594: Time is always a battle here, there are 19 priority projects that all need to get done in parallel, so you often feel like you&#039;re always busy. The feeling is great because you get a sense that you&#039;re working on big projects with large impact, but whew, you get tired sometimes.</p> review1594: * extremely fast paced: be prepared to keep up and not be discouraged by the amount of knowledge you&#039;re expected to absorb * too many interesting things going on: can&#039;t attend all the classes, author visits, celebrity interviews, etc. -- need to have excellent time management</p> review1595: its a compacted place to work and the staff is amazing. I have learned so much from working here and can&#039;t wait to presume my career in the software engineering field.</p> review1596: The hours - typically 16 hour days - are too much even though the environment is great. That&#039;s the only drawback I ever saw at Google.</p> review1597: Very high expectations and a commute from the city to the suburbs means work/life balance takes a hit. Self-direction is also highly prized, which is reflected in both the flatter structure of the company and the management style of several direct supervisors I&#039;ve had--perhaps a pro and a con?</p> review1598: Company has gone a bit overboard in adding multiple levels of management in recent years, and organization feels more top-down than in the past, but neither aspect is too severe. Be prepared for a long commute if you want to live anywhere affordable or interesting. There is an astonishing lack of diversity in political viewpoints; if your heroes are not Barack Obama, Nancy Pelosi, and Paul Krugman, then don&#039;t even think about engaging in a political discussion with your peers (in person or on any internal mailing lists).</p> review1599: Needs help with upper management. notice the little fish. big ideas, etc. corporate.</p> review1600: Overtime..overtime..overtime..and overtime. Frequently work on the weekends</p> review1601: they expect much from employees (and contractors/temps)</p> review1602: Product Managers are rated SOLELY on product launches so if your Eng team can&#039;t or won&#039;t deliver, you&#039;re in trouble. Doesn&#039;t matter if your product is good/bad, just launches count. Extremely competitive and cut throat environment.</p> review1603: Sometimes hard to get to know fellow coworkers outside of your team because it&#039;s such a large company</p> review1603: Hard to maintain work/life balance.</p> review1604: Can be confusing/overwhelming for new hires.</p> review1605: It&#039;s a large company, so there is some (fairly minor) bureaucracy. Otherwise no major concerns or qualms with the company.</p> review1606: Its getting too big and is no longer &#034;flat&#034;. Politics have entered the tent.</p> review1607: Slow career growth, processes are made more complicated by the day</p> review1608: Unless you are a SWE you should not work at Google. Lots of red tape and a complete lack of regard for dogfooder feedback</p> review1609: --they&#039;ve stopped letting people work out of the office they would like, a huge mistake in my view --not a people managers are great; your quality of work like will still vary dramatically depending on who your manager is</p> review1610: -my manager was aggressive -my manager illegally harassed me -HR did nothing about it -I ended up seeking counseling about the problems I was having with my manager -when I told her manager what was going on he told me I should man-up and grow a pair -when I confided in a colleague for advice, that person decided to gossip to the rest of the team about the problem</p> review1611: Always on the cutting edge needs balls</p> review1612: 1) Salary is OK comparing to increased college new hire. You don&#039;t get much increased after hire. 2) Hiring bar is lowering YoY as hiring more people.</p> review1612: 1) Salary is OK comparing to increased college new hire. You don&#039;t get much increased after hire. 2) Hiring bar is lowering YoY as hiring more people.</p> review1613: The number of products and projects can be overwhelm. It&#039;s not easy to maintain a reasonable work-life balance.</p> review1614: - Some co-workers are deluded about how awesome they are. - Company has gotten a lot bigger but mistakenly thinks it can still work like a startup.</p> review1615: Very fast paced. Reorgs all the time. If you&#039;re not proactively bettering your position in the company you can find yourself &#034;reorg&#039;ed&#034; out of a position. Google Offers is an internal starup so very volatile.</p> review1616: -difficult to even get an interview; they screen resumes so at times qualified individuals are easily rejected</p> review1617: - Rigid promotion cycle - Visibility is very hard in such a large company The promotion cycle is very rigid, which isn&#039;t well aligned with the type of talent the company recruits (young go-getters who work hard but expect to see a correlation between effort and reward). Promotions do come but they are heavily relient on putting in a good amount of time first and being recognized by the right people. Managers really have to go to bat for their employees to get them promoted. Also, Google is becoming a much larger company. It prides itself on its start-up roots, but it&#039;s becoming more and more hierarchical, with less and less opportunities to move up or sideways in the company.</p> review1618: Company is becoming too big now &amp; hence little hard to move up the chain.</p> review1619: people. i am an engineer but i like having diversity and not 99% nerds around me 24/7.</p> review1620: its grown into a large company (slower movement)</p> review1621: It is all about the Metrics. On top of achieving above your metrics you need to complete additional high profile projects to get exceed expectations on your performance review. This means you do work ALL of the time even on your vacations!! Most folks feel the burn out since you have to do this quarter after quarter. Especially a tough environment when you have a family.</p> review1621: I don&#039;t think I could share any cons.</p> review1622: Watch out if your company is acquired...Layoffs</p> review1623: - Food didn&#039;t taste that great - Long hours - Shuttles crowded - Good luck finding those smart people - Good luck getting 20% time - No freedom to move around to new teams, promotions difficult - Many employees were extremely weird, even for me - Dreary, depressing campus where everyone seemed unhappy and worried about being seen as stupid. Literally, the place was filled with insecure people that took every opportunity to make themselves feel smarter than everyone. I was singled out and harassed everyday for reasons unknown to me. I was followed around, and whenever I tried to work my co-workers would comment on the code I was writing as I wrote it (or whatever else would throw me off and prevent me from being able to concentrate). They also took workplace monitoring to a new extreme, because it seemed as though everyone around me could access my computer, see what I was doing, and cause my computer to lock up. I was constantly pushed to interact with my co- workers and to ask questions, but each question asked was met with a non-answer and a dismissive attitude as though they were worried I&#039;d use the answer to show them up. At the end of the day it was just a job as the culture was not as advertised.</p> review1624: More challenging to advance outside of headquarters.</p> review1625: Competitive to a fault. The review process is entirely political. There&#039;s a echo chamber. Your individual contribution is probably irrelevant to the company as a whole.</p> review1626: Large company, can seem bureaucratic.</p> review1627: 1. It&#039;s a big, established company. It&#039;s easy to feel like you&#039;re just a cog and will never have a big impact in it. 2. There&#039;s no well-defined career path, which doesn&#039;t bother me personally but might bother people with different personalities. 3. Language choice for performance critical code mostly limited to C++ or Java.</p> review1628: Soem really entitled folks with a lack of real respect for others. A very political space.</p> review1629: Horrible management. They are pretty much clueless.</p> review1630: Very steep learning curve to be productive</p> review1630: managers tend to manage up much better than managing down, often looking out for themselves rather than their team.</p> review1631: So much awesome that not everyone can handle it. Leadership is an important quality because Googlers have more autonomy than at most companies.</p> review1632: Given that there are so many smart people, there is some intellectual elitism. Occasionally, you will find yourself in an incredibly long email thread where people are debating just to debate. Constant pace can burn people out.</p> review1633: For experienced workers, mostly people are looking for greater challenge, more $$$,$$$ and moving up the ladder. This seldom occurs!</p> review1634: Work Hard, Always On, Continuous Change (but this can be good too - just need to be able to handle)</p> review1635: Can be somewhat political at times.</p> review1636: - Might appear fast moving company but it&#039;s a multinational bureaucracy</p> review1637: Crazy schedule, long commute, very busy</p> review1638: Many 1-person projects. Need to learn many layers of Google-specific technology to get anything done.</p> review1639: there is none in my opinion</p> review1639: *elitist and privileged attitude not uncommon *proprietary internal technologies can limit the growth of skills useful outside the company</p> review1640: Too much work, lack of respect, bad work/life balance</p> review1641: None, Great and fun place to work, health benefits, fun people to work with room to develop.</p> review1642: Low salary, repetitive work sometimes boring.</p> review1643: Amazing work is &#034;normal&#034; at Google, so it can be hard to move vertically within the company. Workload can taxing.</p> review1644: need more lanes in the bowling alley</p> review1645: Google is a large company. Even though it does a great job at trying to stay agile and keep a startup culture alive, it does have the feel of a large corporation.</p> review1646: layers of management, managers who don&#039;t help you develop, reorgs every so often</p> review1647: Bureaucracy. Low hourly rate for the amount of responsibility.</p> review1648: I&#039;ve since left Google; many of my early-day colleagues have moved to more nimble environments where the work has a deeper impact. The company has gotten very &#034;heavy&#034; with many layers of experts, all who bring the complexity they developed from other world-class companies they have worked in. A close friend told me &#034;there are other companies out there who ARE what Google USED TO BE&#034; which is to say, very lean and intimate. I love the startup mentality and the opportunity to make huge moves with everything you work on. Google is like a very large ship now; many oars must move in order to effect a turn or feel the ship shift slightly in direction.</p> review1648: It&#039;s a religion &amp; a cult of youth. If you&#039;re not a 20-something, you&#039;ll feel out of place. If you&#039;ve got any grey hair, you&#039;re DOA.</p> review1649: There are no cons here</p> review1650: Google is a very large company; it&#039;s difficult for an individual to have a big impact. With lots of top employees, it can be difficult to excel. Google is very engineering-focused (great if you&#039;re an engineer, less so if you&#039;re not).</p> review1651: Can be hard to find projects with high impact due to the companies size.</p> review1652: Some Googlers are self-entitled and not just to non-Googlers but to other Googlers as well. I blame it on poor hiring decisions. There&#039;s tremendous growth at Google and sometimes despite their best intentions, poor hiring decisions are made. In some parts of the business, it&#039;s very political. Can be challenging if you don&#039;t know how to play the game. Some managers are too busy to show their reports tough love or real 1:1 mentoring.</p> review1653: Might be difficult to work remotely Disorganized Not as much of a flat hierarchy as they want People get a sense of entitlement</p> review1654: Not as flexible as before</p> review1655: - Little career progression. The company likes to think they are flat but in reality they have deep hierarchical leves (There were 10 people between me and the CEO) but there is no clear way to become manager and each manager manages 12 or more people. - Sales is an afterthought completely. The engineers are rightfully the stars but for the sales people the salaries are half what you can earn in other places. - In spite that they say otherwise, pedigree counts a lot. Top salesman globally with no brand name makes half (counting comission, bonuses, stock, etc.) of what another salesman makes as base salary and comes from the &#034;right&#034; (Ivy league, big names on resume) background. - If you are not in the right group your day to day work is boring and mundane. - Low engagement of people with their jobs (in the sales org). That makes for very uninteresting meal chats about ski trips and vegas conventions.</p> review1656: It was a pretty long walk from my desk to the one sundae machine on the floor. Like really. One per floor? Animals</p> review1657: it is not easy to enter and you must work hard and maybe you have to take much pressure. But it is worth.</p> review1657: arbitrary product roadmaps outside the search/ads world</p> review1658: There is a massive learning curve and it can takes months to become a contributing member of the team. Working in C++ is slow and painful. Engineers could sometimes explain things better.</p> review1659: Career opportunities are in Mountain View and New York offices only. The Old School cheery Googlers have been replaced with the MBA sharks looking for a feather in their career cap, so come with your Excel and Powerpoint data in hand if you want to succeed. The customer-service came second only to internal posturing which happens with any desirable place to work. It&#039;s unfortunate, but when you answer to shareholders, the almighty dollar is all that matters. Google gives you free lunch and a laptop to keep you on the hook - the job hook. When you mature to having a family and need that work-life balance, Google isn&#039;t the place to be.</p> review1660: Management is decreasingly transparent. Internal transfers are near-impossible.</p> review1661: no training, place you on a team without consulation, not much control of your career, manager driven. if manage is not competent of does not like you things are very bad</p> review1662: I used to love this company and thought we contributed a great deal to help the industry and society, and that we could do no harm. Unfortunately, I don&#039;t believe this about the company anymore, and I have recently lost a great deal of confidence in the current leadership team. The company has recently become run much more top down than the bottoms up nature of the years past.</p> review1663: Very competitive environment to work in.</p> review1664: So many activities, not enough time to do actual work</p> review1665: too much too do too little time.</p> review1666: Disclaimer: Google is the most decentralized company I&#039;ve worked for in the degree to which different groups and projects have their own work intensity, culture, ambitiousness, manager quality, etc. A lot of people I know love working here, feel they are working on interesting/important projects, and are full of respect for their colleagues and leadership. My experience, unfortunately, has been almost entirely negative: - problems start with the hiring process because they put up vaguely described job openings, don&#039;t tell you almost anything about what you&#039;ll be working on during the interview, and then don&#039;t make any attempt to match you to projects you might care about or have experience with. The implied message is - you made it to Google, so you&#039;re smart enough to learn new technology, languages, and skills as needed, and we give you so much that you should be happy working on anything. After working here for several months, my impress ion was: - self-satisfaction, detachment/cluelessness/apathy and arrogance are prevalent including at the very top. - too many of the company&#039;s core slogans frequently don&#039;t reflect reality: - treating employees with respect - actually condescension disguised as benevolence - caring about users - actually often dismissing them as a nuisance or too stupid to use the product correctly. - setting goals that are so ambitious that you fail on some - actually often failing on un-ambitious goals for non-respectable reasons - openness in communicating with employees - actually, most communications end up being empty hype and ass-kissing. - maximise efficiency and productivity - actually, even simple web front ends requires constant battle against unrelated problems with unreasonably slow or broken internal APIs, overly slow build/test/deploy tools, lack of documentation for how to use internal systems, etc. - fast-paced entrepreneurial culture - actually, for too many peop le, the main objective is to look good and score points with their manager - this is true all the way up to the VPs that report to Larry - hire the best people - almost everybody here is really smart, but the culture often brings out the worst most unprofessional side of people - taking risks and changing the world - level of risk I see people taking is changing the location of a UI button on an internal tool without talking to the product manager first</p> review1666: No high pay. Not much room for improvement for the average minded.</p> review1667: Hiring process is pretty convoluted, and some policies are annoying, but ultimately are sensical and tolerated since they typically relate to important core company values.</p> review1668: Too many possibilities can make narrowing your options difficult, but worthwhile in the end</p> review1669: large company, a little too much red tape for a company that size</p> review1670: There is none best company ever</p> review1671: Not much to say about cons</p> review1672: -Challenging, a bit ambiguous at times, need to be able to manage yourself</p> review1673: Very few downsides. Things move quickly, and for most that&#039;s a great thing.</p> review1674: It&#039;s a very large company. You will not know most people there.</p> review1675: * there are many rules you have to follow such as code review</p> review1675: none that I can think of, it is great. they might want to implement a better way to get promoted to help people at the bottom to make moreof a name for themselves</p> review1676: too crowded for traffic and work / life around</p> review1677: Boring, Long Hours, Early in the morning, micromanaged, Repetitive</p> review1678: Management quality is clearly below what&#039;s required for a company of this size. It&#039;s incredibly difficult for someone senior to get up to speed to a degree where they&#039;d feel comfortable.</p> review1679: You should really love what you do. Google wants you to be active, responsive and productive.</p> review1680: Busy, often stressful, frequent change,</p> review1681: Transportation are sometimes not good</p> review1682: Much is expected of your performance, culture is geared towards mainly very young employees</p> review1683: May have to relocate to NY or MTV</p> review1684: There are no cons as such. There are a lot of great people here. The perks are great as well.</p> review1684: lousy commute expensive rent high cost of living bad life style choices by peers abrasive managers</p> review1685: There is a lot of exciting work and it can overtake your personal life.</p> review1686: nothing&#039;s perfect, as each person&#039;s experience and what they&#039;re looking for can be so different.</p> review1687: The work became too much customer support focused so one couldn&#039;t get enough time for project and self development. Besides, one doesn&#039;t get enough support from the management.</p> review1688: The company is growing so fast that it is starting to show signs of a more corporate environment that is bridled by bureaucracy.</p> review1689: you&#039;ll have to be in Mountain View to fully experience what it&#039;s like to work for Google.</p> review1690: There is no fun like working in startups. Working Google is just no more than working in a big company.</p> review1691: Too big to take risks - hard to justify taking major risks with the core offering (search and ads). Partners are threatened by size - hard to get data from partners who are afraid we&#039;re going to eventually enter their markets.</p> review1692: free food, bad managers, alot of free time</p> review1693: It&#039;s a large company and with that comes bureaucracy. Execs do a good job minimizing it, but there is only so much they can do.</p> review1693: Some things are becoming more corporate and bureaucratic than they used to be.</p> review1694: -Promotion process can be really challenging</p> review1695: Very competitive, harder to get promoted.</p> review1696: High living cost. The workload is high.</p> review1697: People here don&#039;t know how to program.</p> review1698: One thing that Google does a bit is hire really smart people and put them into more basic positions. A lot of people that were there when I first joined on my team are now gone, as everyone has either left to another team or left the company as a whole.</p> review1699: Inability to significantly grow accounts/make money, micro-management</p> review1700: - Low pay - Slow professional growth - Large company with heavy bureaucratic tendencies</p> review1701: everything that the company provides is great</p> review1702: My job had a lot of turnover. They just hire 1 year contractors and never re-up them. Would have loved to stay.</p> review1702: - Managers are too busy to give feedback (only once a month). They are not on the same page with the lead and it&#039;s quite confusing what they&#039;re looking for sometimes. - They don&#039;t really put you in a team that matches your experience/interest. You can get stuck in a team for at least a year when you start working there - Extremely high workload</p> review1703: too much work, too much stress, politics is growing. hyper competetive know it alls abound in this company. not even the best conpany to work for in bay read</p> review1704: I think that internal mobility could be improved. It&#039;s easy to start to work on something as 20%, but when it comes to 100% it&#039;s a bit tricky. That means you can get stuck for a while in a project that you don&#039;t really like. Also there is certain degree of bureaucracy. Maybe it&#039;s just me, but I hate creating tickets and filling e-forms. Whenever you want to request something, you need to do those things.</p> review1705: Large employee base makes the company feel less intimate</p> review1706: Very easy to get burned out when trying to exceed expectations. Mandatory promotions required based on time employed to meet job expectations</p> review1707: My team&#039;s management is incompetent and strives to build walls between employees and contractors. They suffer from a lack of transparency, a lack of understanding about the specific work that we do, and poor communication skills. The end result is that an entire group of dedicated contractors now harbors a distrust and a dislike for Google.</p> review1708: not i am aware of, but i will keep finding them. maybe they should turn the ac on more often</p> review1709: Google is not a vey diverse workplace, but I did like most of the people I worked with.</p> review1710: not a great place to &#034;start&#034; your career - not a lot of upward mobility</p> review1711: Big company, can be ineffective.</p> review1711: everything was fine with work</p> review1712: Google is now a big place.</p> review1713: Google is not as startup-y anymore.</p> review1714: Very flat organization, limited opportunities outside engineering and sales. Sales office becoming more and more faceless -- not at all Googley. Long term client relationships sacrifices for short-term quota gains.</p> review1715: Difficult to get in, and even when you are in, it&#039;s still competitive.</p> review1716: To much food! Not many!</p> review1717: You get Noogler 15. 15 pounds after joining Google.</p> review1718: Nothing that happens or has ever happened in software engineering is interesting, relevant, or good unless it happened at Google. Prior experience in barbarian companies is considered irrelevant or harmful. Groupthink and NIH syndrome lead to some daft decisions that are considered holy and irrevocable within the company.</p> review1719: There&#039;s a bit of a disconnect between product (Eng/PM) and operations. Somewhat bureaucratic.</p> review1720: I have absolutely no cons to share.</p> review1720: big and slow, too many silos very distributed, very hard to tell what is going on closed, NIH environment and technology inconsistent and political promotion process</p> review1721: The main campus is very crowded. People share either large cubicles or work in open space so it is very easy to get distracted specially when a group of people have a discussion or someone speaks on the phone. It can also be hard to find a good place make a personal phone call.</p> review1722: Limited career progression for non-engineers. It&#039;s a great place to be if you&#039;re a middle aged and settled down with a family. It&#039;s become very political and hard to get things done with so many departments and matrices.</p> review1723: there is no negative information that i can come up with at this time</p> review1724: Promotions are few and far between and career progression is tough to manage, but when successful, it pays off. You must be a self-starter to succeed.</p> review1725: None that don&#039;t exist elsewhere: the occasional bad manager, underperforming employee.</p> review1726: Getting larger and more political. If you&#039;re not working on a project that is clearly important it can be difficult to get noticed by senior management.</p> review1727: Blind allocation: Your initial assignment may have nothing to do with your interests or experience, and policy is that you must stay in that assignment for 18 months before you can transfer (though there are exceptions). Google&#039;s success makes it difficult to criticize; &#034;How can we be doing it wrong if we&#039;re making this much money?&#034;</p> review1728: It can be hard to keep track of everything going on.</p> review1729: No cons so far to date</p> review1729: Commute to south bay, some politics, people worrying about things which aren&#039;t real problems, getting hassled on LinkedIn, can be difficult to move up, managers variable</p> review1730: None that I&#039;ve found so far</p> review1731: Pace can be relentless. Not a great place to move up the ladder because there is so much competition. Promotions to management seem pretty political. Your manager may not have any interpersonal and leadership abilities. If that happens, try to move on quickly.</p> review1732: The work can be very monotonous, as a lower level employee, input isn&#039;t really valued. As it&#039;s a very large company, the scope of what you&#039;re expected to do is quite narrow. They like you to specialize in one thing and ultimately, your value will be determined on how well you execute THAT particular function.</p> review1733: Huge sense of entitlement. Company is run by engineers, product owners are all ex-engineers who may or may not know what is best for consumers or the marketplace. Company does not know how to fire low performers</p> review1734: Nothing I can think of.</p> review1735: The ratio of full-time employees to contractors is 1:100 for the Bothell office, There is very little chance at promotion for an astonishing amount of work completed beyond what&#039;s required</p> review1736: We&#039;ve grown too quickly, making it difficult to get things done as quickly as we were able to years ago. We&#039;ve also focused on hiring elite students and MBA grads, who don&#039;t always have the street sense needed in a dynamic and changing sales organization.</p> review1737: Bad mid-level management, without a great way to do career development. Discipline around people management relatively weak. Review model ok, not great.</p> review1738: Nothing fundamentally bad about the company.</p> review1738: It is getting a little bit too political in Google, which I guess is only natural for 40K company. PMs tend to take a bit too much credit for everything around, Engineering are very isolated (maybe by design) from operation/monetization aspects. Other functions are secondary to PM and Engineering in almost every aspect. Vision is increasingly a top-down thing with less and less grass root initiatives .......... working on your 20% these days mean your bonus will probably disappear because you need your manager sign-off, which likely has a different agenda, and his own 20%</p> review1739: Almost everyone is smart and hardworking, which creates some pressure. This is healthy for the company and the career, though.</p> review1740: It definitely feels like a big company, which means it&#039;s super-easy to coast and not do a whole lot, and it&#039;s super easy to feel like you&#039;re working on a tiny part of a gigantic company. Lots of free food doesn&#039;t make up for that.</p> review1741: Pay is pretty low right niow</p> review1742: i don&#039;t think there are any cons worth mentioning</p> review1743: No longer feels like a startup. Management layer is thick.</p> review1744: Has become a LARGE company but still tries to act as if it were a nimble startup. Promotion has become more about networking than anything else. Getting harder to get promoted.</p> review1745: Driving aroung LA is not fun</p> review1746: The vast majority of the people who made Google what it is today have move on and in many cases have been replaced by cookie-cutter MBA types, ex Microsoft employees and management consultants. This combined with Google&#039;s massive growth (18k employees in Mountain View alone) has made it less of the agile innovator it once was but rather a techno-advertising behemoth.</p> review1747: The culture rewards the top performers. It favors young professionals who just graduated and have tons of time to dedicate to work. It is much more difficult for experienced contributors who have constraints outside the office: family, hobbies, etc.</p> review1747: Sales org has too many internal processes, structure, best practices... meetings about meetings, politics, ever changing sales org, limited autonomy/flexibility.</p> review1748: Very competitive.. not great if you are unwilling to work hard.</p> review1749: Finance is a 2nd class function (at best) and in general has very limited power within the organization. This can make it difficult to make a difference or even be heard outside of the org. Often, those who succeed in finance are those that can please their business partners in Engineering/Product which can cause incredible conflicts of interest (sure, that acquisition looks fabulous and it&#039;s only $100M! I can make an analysis that makes it look great ) - even if not explicit the pressure to please powerful VPs in Eng is intense. This is compounded by the hyper-reliance on 360 feedback and networking which means it can be hard to make a change or stand up if something seems wrong. Finance is primarily full of investment bankers &amp; consultants, with little folks with actual Corp Finance experience. This causes an amazing amount of inefficiency as folks don&#039;t understand how to do basic things like create a budget and expect people to stick to it (seriou sly - within weeks of budget creation no one knows if budget applies anymore or if we&#039;re moving to a monthly forecast view instead). At first, I tried very hard to get more Corp Finance folks in the org but now I actually think IBankers do best as folks with actual CF experience tend to be so shocked by the Google processes (or lack thereof) they simply cannot hang. Work/life balance is dreadful - since the employee base is generally young and former bankers, most folks don&#039;t seem to be upset by late nights stretching past midnight but for those with families (or even those that just enjoy their lives outside of work) this can be painful. Especially since most of the time is spent on projects that go nowhere. Google elects not to use ERP or other established software in favor of developing their own solutions. Then they don&#039;t staff these solutions with adequate Eng resources. Result is an incredible lack of data availability with the expectation that finance b e &#034;scrappy&#034; to find ways to tease out or completely guess at the data. Upside is that without a data source no one&#039;s likely to know if you&#039;re completely off base - but this can be unsettling for folks who really want to use reliable info to make business decisions. There are constant reorgs and reprioritizations at Google - particularly if you don&#039;t support the Search / Ads business. Forget about focusing on anything that will take more than 1 Q to achieve. This is a social/extroverted environment which means that those who are good at networking have an edge over those who don&#039;t, even if the folks who don&#039;t are doing a superior job. I&#039;ve taken advantage of it myself but it&#039;s not fair.</p> review1750: Company growing too big, still hard to move around regardless.</p> review1751: Flexibility and openness have taken a nose dive as the company became larger and more compartmentalized. No one wants you to work on &#034;the world&#039;s most interesting problems&#034; no matter what their employment ads say. 20% time has become a myth. No one wants you working on their projects, or on your own.</p> review1752: Sometimes you feel like a very small fish in a big sea. Promotion process isn&#039;t the best. I&#039;ve seen a number of people receive promotions who definitely didn&#039;t deserve it, while others who do, get passed over.</p> review1753: Hard to maintain their unique culture as the company grows bigger</p> review1754: Being such a world renown company, each dept is very restrictive of allowing external access. It&#039;s a bit difficult to get cross-departmental collaboration in general.</p> review1755: Demographic skews young and inexperienced. Can be a little chaotic at times, disorganized approach to product development. Easy to get lost in the sea of work that has to be done.</p> review1756: Could be Better, overall feel</p> review1756: I think you can become extremely complacent and just not want to leave.</p> review1757: Things can move very fast at Google, which means it can be somewhat stressed. It depends on the projects you work on, though.</p> review1758: Very Good company, no negative sides.</p> review1759: A bit chaotic with some pockets of unhealthiness. In a tradeoff for simplicity the organization is becoming more top down. You have less freedom to pick projects and transfers are becoming more difficult, and they were hard to beging with. You are measured by a perf cycle every quarter.</p> review1760: Ex mcKinsey folks become sheep like here and forget that their insights could be used to affect change at a Recruiting function that is lackluster (take them out of The gplex) they couldnt recruit top talent. Several recruiting leaders from the UK and seem to lack basic strategy skills but excel at their own PR Recruiting is a protracted process that doesn&#039;t need to be Hiring Managers take mediocre results and lack ability to sniff good recruiting talent from folks that talk a good game Recruiters cow tow to a team of paper pushers that review Packets to the detriment of great candidates and candidate experience</p> review1761: it is a big org, and that has its political and speed challenges, but in all its a wonderful place to work.</p> review1762: No Cons- I was finished with my internship and went back to school</p> review1763: The relentless pace often means that you have to get things out of the door before they are completely ready, and can do a number on your work/life balance (especially if you work in Android).</p> review1764: sometime long hours around project deadlines</p> review1765: Big company. Lots of people.</p> review1765: Steep learning curve, be prepared to have to constantly adapt and refactor code. Getting tasks done is a bit harder than usual here as there are a lot more things to take into consideration, such as scale, security, testing, etc. (but granted they also yield a lot better results than in other places). It gets better with time though.</p> review1766: It&#039;s hard work! If you&#039;re smart enough to get hired and you learn the stack, you&#039;ll do fine, but overachieving coworkers make it difficult to stand out. Listening to coworkers complain about how their scallops weren&#039;t cooked properly :)</p> review1767: large and sometimes feels like it, need to coordinate with my teams/stakeholders</p> review1768: Not one I can see right now.</p> review1769: A lot of inquisitive questions from outsiders about inside work.</p> review1770: Honestly, I have had nothing but a good experience working here.</p> review1771: too big, very specific to teams - make sure you join a good team with a good manager, there are a lot of bad managers there.</p> review1772: Too big now, not as good as before. The google plus is very disappointing, seems too many managment now. However it is common in every big company.</p> review1773: Very hard to get a chance to be in this company...</p> review1774: Everything is pretty complicated so a lot of work goes into researching potential adverse interactions.</p> review1774: Not use of one&#039;s talent, not much work to do,</p> review1775: Because there are so many bright people working at Google, it&#039;s difficult to stand out and get recognized for a job well done. There is a quota on promotions that can be given out each period, and there is lack of visibility on the criteria involved. There are a lot of lateral movement opportunities but not upward movement within a department.</p> review1776: - Limited upside prospects unless you&#039;re (a) personally critical to the business and (b) threatening to leave for another company - HR process for internal mobility isn&#039;t working well - Opaque resource allocation process</p> review1777: Very competitive environment some times to much. Some people will not share information to get ahead of you.</p> review1778: Really none with the company, but living expenses in the bay area are crazy and although salaries are good they don&#039;t make up for the cost of living.</p> review1779: A bit harder to climb the corporate ladder when you&#039;re working in a regional office. Those folks in regional offices, know what I mean.</p> review1780: Shifted strategies a couple times. May have been worthwhile to see how certain ones played out before shifting again.</p> review1781: Sometimes can be confusing, if you&#039;re not sure what interest you most.</p> review1782: Too busy, not good work life balance</p> review1783: Becoming a &#034;big company&#034;. Harder to get things done than it used to be</p> review1783: Culture of secrecy The sense that everyone&#039;s expendable No work/life balance or autonomy Immature and/or inexperienced middle managers</p> review1784: Try to do too many things</p> review1785: If you&#039;re in a remote office (outside MTV), it can be hard to make lateral moves in your career.</p> review1786: I can&#039;t really think of any. The commute takes some time, but the company provides very frequent shuttles.</p> review1787: All of the pros mentioned above are getting weaker as the company starts to plateau and tries to squeeze out more revenue. Product managers may be surprised at how little power they have relative to at other companies - at Google it is the engineers that really run things.</p> review1788: They pay really smart people to do so-so jobs at an entry level. This can be frustrating and the path to more meaningful work is often ambiguous.</p> review1789: I didn&#039;t get the chance to select my own projects. It is mostly handed down to you. If you are new you get the not so good projects.</p> review1790: Has become a big company. People not working as hard as before.</p> review1791: Got too big. Too diverse. Duplicate efforts.</p> review1792: - Large company so your project might seem small in comparison (even when it impacts millions of users) - Career management is on the onus of the employee (but this might not be a problem once you hit senior which can be the steady state and you are comfortable with the work)</p> review1792: - Sometimes the pace is a little intense and hard to keep up with. - The bar is very high; you might feel like you are an overachiever, but in comparison to your coworkers (who are also overachievers) it&#039;s difficult to stand out. - Not everything can be quantified, which can sometimes mean some contributions are under-valued in a numbers driven company.</p> review1793: none, absolutely none, believe me</p> review1794: Big place that&#039;s easy for some people to feel lost Steep learning curve that&#039;s hard on newcomers Impatience for results</p> review1795: Work load in google is kind of full. You have work very hard to get good performance/</p> review1796: Program Managers fresh out of grad school who pretend like they know the product better than you do will shoot down all your ideas or input regardless of your experience. There is no clear direction or priorities set with specific projects.</p> review1797: All the benefits are designed to get you to work more Large company is starting to forget about the individual</p> review1798: Google sucks when it comes to bringing on board new talent with a strong and accomplished caliber and assisting its integration into the operations. Instead of making the younger and less experienced work-force absorb the experience and Know-How, Google embraced a weak and overly flat environment which allows the least experienced ones set the tone and fight off external Know-How and experience. That&#039;s not really a company that wants to change but rather a company that it suffers from massive turn-over in sales and business operations and instead of fighting it off with a confident infusion of experience operations leader, it created an overly flat and &#039;fuzzy&#039; environment, where everyone is obsessed with trying to please others and be sweet on the expense of doing the right thing.</p> review1799: Quarter performance evaluations can be a little wearing. Good communication with the technical leadership on your project is a must for success a Google.</p> review1800: Google is becoming more hierarchical. You can move up through the ranks, but if you start at entry-level, it will take you 15+ years to get to senior management. Use it as a stepping stone to another job outside the company or move laterally and gain experience in different roles</p> review1801: Very little supervision, some times, new hires do not know what not to do. Maybe that&#039;s the way to encourage and cultivate creativity!</p> review1801: Nothing really. Big company now, so more processes than there used to be.</p> review1802: The credit of your work goes to someone Else...</p> review1803: Becoming too large, no more start up feel</p> review1804: High variance in manager competence, including some managers whose only &#039;skill&#039; appears to have been being lucky enough to join pre-IPO. From my experience - despite massive amounts of &#039;data&#039;, in the form of Googlegeist, employees reaching out to HR to express concerns, and almost universal team dissatisfaction, some really bad managers are simply not dealt with. Really bloated management structure outside of Eng, which means that many people are doing work that is below their level of skill, simply because there are so many layers of management above them. Think the company would actually benefit from a higher turnover rate. Bias against any sort of standardization, even though at the current size of the company, some standardization is needed.</p> review1805: Things move too slow, despite efforts to improve Can&#039;t avoid feeling like a number in certain roles Lots of work to maintain products--crowds out time/energy for step-function innovations</p> review1806: The work hours are somewhat lengthy</p> review1807: - Like most development jobs, the company will take all the hours you want to give (the flip side is that I&#039;ve never been asked to work more than 40, nor has it been implied I should). - Whatever tools you may have learned elsewhere, you won&#039;t use them at Google, because Google has it&#039;s own implementations of everything. - A follow-on to the last point, if you leave Google and try to join an employer who is looking for skills in specific tools, they won&#039;t be the tools you used at Google. That said, it&#039;s hard to think having &#034;Google&#034; on your resume won&#039;t more than compensate.</p> review1808: tough seniors tough work lesser growth salary could be better</p> review1809: There are too many snacks.</p> review1810: - Lot of politics, especially at higher levels - Lots of redundant work. Many teams seem to be doing the same thing without knowledge of each others work - Too many law suits distracts attention from building good products - Too many &#034;me too&#034; products.</p> review1810: - Don&#039;t work in a small office (&lt; 200 engineers) if you can help it. You will feel disconnected. Culture and connections are Silicon Valley centric. - Many great projects are worked in, many get cancelled for opaque reasons, which can be tough if you are on the team. - It is a big company, even though everyone is smart and trying to do the right thing, there are still big company politics and the feeling of being a small cog in a very big wheel. - Management tries to be transparent, but sometimes when they can&#039;t or don&#039;t want to, it blows up in their face. - Mountain View employee culture is one of entitlement. In particular, I recall that when a new cafe opened up (the 19th one or so on campus) but was reserved for a group working on a confidential project, that there was open complaining about &#034;its not fair, why don&#039;t we get to go to that cafe?&#034;</p> review1811: It&#039;s a big corporation so everything is by the book and restrictions are tight.</p> review1812: Long hours. Lots of work. Often collaborating with other who were not on the same schedule. Different schedule than the rest of the world.</p> review1813: You are evaluated on impact, but with the size of Google it is increasingly difficult to make a mark and get the recognition needed to advance. Increased visibility means increased product risk and a higher bar for new releases, making it difficult to get something to market without enlisting executive help to overcome risk aversion (bureaucratic obstacles).</p> review1814: Not all managers know how to manage humans, search quality is very political, lack of company focus, turning into a hierarchical company.</p> review1815: The place is a mad house. There are so many people every where. It takes forever to go anywhere and the elevators are paced during lunch hours. Most of the people are walking around in jeans and t-shirts with head phones on. If you like that than you like Google.</p> review1816: Agressive schedule, ad hoc review process, ad hoc communications and organizations, distractive and non focused planning, not goal oriented, not into profit</p> review1817: As the company becomes bigger, some random decisions happen.</p> review1818: Before I joined Google, I was a superstar engineer. Now that I joined and am surrounded by superstars, I am just &#034;average&#034;. Sigh.</p> review1819: Getting large, more complex, dabbling in a lot of areas, innovators dillema.</p> review1819: far commute a lot of competition</p> review1820: Google has become just another big software company (like Microsoft or Amazon). The Kirkland office feels like Microsoft or Amazon depending on where your Google Director originally was recruited from.</p> review1821: Unless you are a superstar individual and knows how to socialize with other super star, the upside for career advancement is not too promising.</p> review1822: You are encouraged to work against your &#034;teammates&#034; in your fight to the top and talk bad about them; Building a sense of community is discouraged</p> review1823: Tough place to advance if you&#039;re not an Engineer or in an office where there are non-engineer (i.e. MTV) opportunities.</p> review1824: Can become chaotic or disorganized due to quick page and large scale. Just on the border of disrupting work/life balance.</p> review1825: Tight competitions, lots of engineers, too many projects going on. Lots of people and thus hard to get a voice up directly.</p> review1826: Despite Google&#039;s efforts to maintain a startup-like atmosphere, it&#039;s still true that big-company hurdles -- like legal issues, regulatory concerns, and just standard VP approval processes for big decisions -- can slow down the process of doing cool things. And although the average talent level is quite high, the discipline and effectiveness of individual engineers can still vary somewhat significantly, so sometimes you&#039;ll have to deal with people who just don&#039;t work as quickly or independently as you&#039;d like. Finally, in an engineering-centric company like Google, a PM can occasionally feel a little like the &#034;e-mailer in chief,&#034; a person who nags other people a lot but doesn&#039;t get to do &#034;real&#034; work and who doesn&#039;t get the same respect as an engineer.</p> review1827: Terrible commute and overpriced housing nearby. Some big company politics.</p> review1828: Google is getting to be a quite large company. It&#039;s nearly impossible to know about everything that&#039;s going on in every organization. Furthermore, the love from the public has waned in recent years which can be a bit of a bummer.</p> review1828: -Actual day to day work not as exciting as it seems (lots of Excel, etc) -Lots of gossip inside and outside the company that account managers are just &#034;glorified telemarketers&#034; -Does not pay as well as finance internships though Google would like to compete with these sorts of internship programs at elite schools and campuses -Does not seem like a place you stick around too long; a young environment with lots of movement and attrition. -Recruiting process slow, flawed, and disorganized</p> review1829: Management, co-workers, try to directly copy other products, location</p> review1830: There really isn&#039;t much that could be described as a Con. There are some growing pains as the company decides the right balance between more process and maintaining creativity and a slight sense of chaos in the various groups.</p> review1831: It&#039;s hard to get promoted. Performance is decided mostly by your peers, which means promotion is essentially a popularity contest.</p> review1832: While not totally necessary, being on a higher profile project helps with recognition and career advancement. I work on one such project and have since I&#039;ve been at Google, so I can&#039;t really say what it&#039;s like if you work on other projects. Having a good manager (as I do) is definitely important to being promoted and getting put on projects where you can earn recognition. Not all managers are as awesome as mine and their reports suffer for it in terms of career growth and interesting tasks to work on.</p> review1833: - Sometimes a bit too relaxed - Lots of internally developed tools that can only be learned on the job</p> review1834: Middle management was a bit slow. Things are getting more bureaucratic; it can be very hard to get things done.</p> review1835: If you get in as a contractor at the wrong time it&#039;s impossible to get hire to FTE Not any training, still acts like a start up Too many recruiters--we were sometimes stepping on each other with candidates</p> review1836: It became way too political, specially with upper management completely lost its way and lacking a vision.</p> review1837: To thrive at Google as a software engineer, at least a Masters degree in computer science or equivalent course of study is needed. A Google employee without a masters degree or Phd will not see the same opportunities for advancement or career development. Some of the technologies used at Google are proprietary, so skills developed in those technologies are not relevant at other tech companies.</p> review1837: MTV is in California, which means higher tax rate, higher living cost, etc. However, you may make more money in google than other companies.</p> review1838: Lack of innovation. The heyday of Google seems to be passed. Things are good but probably not as perfect as you might imagine it because the hey day has passed.</p> review1839: Career growth is somewhat difficult for non standard profiles (i.e. not Software Engineers or Site Reliability Engineers). Managers need to be good to get their reports promoted. Being on the &#034;right&#034; project (aka high impact with high visibility) does affect substantially career growth.</p> review1840: becoming a big company, too many mckinsey types in sales roles, politics starting to grow, easier to come in new to a senior role than be promoted into it</p> review1841: Google is changing, and it&#039;s experiencing some growing pains. There are new projects and focus areas every week, and the grouping of functions and teams changes constantly. As a result, managers are responsible to new macro functional groups, and new projects or focus areas every month or so. This seems an unnecessary distraction, amounting to 25% superfluous work. The change in org structure has made it hard to maintain the career path of your choice. Instead, you must choose from available Google-centric career paths. These are not always (or often) composed of conventional roles, since Google is both changing rapidly, and unconventional to begin with. Most of the people hired at Google 5+ years ago, don&#039;t have the credentials to be hired there today. This complicates internal transfers, even though HR attempts to solve that issue. Those joining Google from acquisitions are rarely hirable at Google in any other way, yet their experience and contributio ns once onboard are typically at par. This again complicates the internal transfer process.</p> review1842: Shocked by the rather incompetent recruiting leadership on the sales team supporting at best a rather mediocre experience for hiring managers and candidates. Rote, robot like recruiting process which is driven by levels and espouses &#034;in the box&#034; thinking. Middle managers (Staffing Managers) are the epitomy of let&#039;s do things to please Larry vs. let&#039;s question and innovate. Google Recruiting is like a big filter. Mediocre Staffing Managers that measure against silly metrics and measure the team on a curve they themselves could never meet. Everyone is afraid to question the process or make changes. HR is a puppet at best with no strong recruiting leaders pushing innovation.</p> review1843: Now Google is big or even huge, all kinds of people, hate the bureaucracy there, reminds me of IBM or Microsoft pyramid management</p> review1844: Essentially Google has more than a few terrible middle managers. This is mostly because the really great people will often leave for school or more lucrative opportunities (because getting promotions can be very difficult) and often the people who stay are those who bide their time and are solid but not rock start performers. So your Google experience will depend a lot on who your direct manager is...</p> review1845: Things change fast! Need to stay on your toes!</p> review1846: over-time work. seems everyone works late on weekends.</p> review1846: It&#039;s still a very big company. It&#039;s not microsoft yet, but it&#039;s getting there. It&#039;s a pretty long chain of command.</p> review1847: Poor communications between software development uniits were tolerated by management. Management never communicated its goals leaving engineering and consulting in the dark. Software quality was so poor that customers were dissatisfied and continuously threatening to halt the projects. Payment was withheld leading to more pressure to cut costs and diminished software quality. There was no QA on software prior to installation at the customer site. There were many problems with benefits administration caused by the third party firm hired to manage those items.</p> review1848: Too many incompetent mid-level managers</p> review1849: As Google is expanding, it is losing a lot of appeals from the good old days of being a start-up. The transparency between upper management and ordinary employees is not as it is used to be.</p> review1850: 24/7 job no guidance on your own for growth</p> review1851: It was under a 2 year (only) temporary contract. It gave little growth for promotion within the company. I would have loved to get hired in.</p> review1852: Hardly any, there are literally no reasons not to intern here.</p> review1853: getting very political, a lot of nepotism. Very negative vibe from employees regarding manager competency.</p> review1854: For more senior people, odds are, you&#039;re going to be waiting a long time for any kind of promotion. You will also be way older than most of the people you work with, and your manager may or may not understand family commitments. (Google in general does.) Your manager may or may not care about you. If you get a good manager, great. If you get a lousy one, it may or may not get fixed in any reasonable amount of time, and it can be hard to transfer out if you&#039;re having any difficulty with your manager. I had the worst manager of my 30 year career there, and should have just quit after I figured that out.</p> review1855: Party culture, some people seem to be there for the perks.</p> review1855: Difficult to get an offer.</p> review1856: The work-life balance is hard to achieve</p> review1857: No particular cons I can think of</p> review1858: There was nothing wrong there!</p> review1859: no room to really advance. You&#039;re just a number.</p> review1860: Having good management seems to be a non-goal, at least below the highest levels. The only requirements for becoming a manager are having good enough technical skills to reach the correct job level, and expressing interest. Because of this, middle management is extremely hit-or-miss. Employees are often expected to figure out how to grow on their own, with little or no guidance, even for those fresh out of school. Many managers still have technical responsibilities, and let their people-management responsibilities fall by the wayside. It is unclear so far just how Larry Page taking over as CEO will affect the company as a whole, at least in terms of work environment.</p> review1861: As a contractor there is a lack of transparency about the opportunity for conversion to permanent roles. Also, many young colleagues complain that no other company recruits so many bright people to then put them in very low level jobs with remedial tasks.</p> review1862: Slow recruiting and conversion process Such a large company that it&#039;s difficult to be organized (in terms of knowing how to get a certain piece of information or resource)</p> review1863: The first month was very rough for me. I was given no real introduction to the company, and had to learn by fire. The security restrictions on your personal computer and network get in the way of productivity, and are generally frustrating. I need to have a field tech come to my workstation to install software that doesn&#039;t happen to be whitelisted.</p> review1864: Low pay, interview process is extremely rigorous.</p> review1864: Can be hard to transfer to a new project, which can lead to the need to excel at something you don&#039;t like in order to earn your way out of it. The opportunities for 20% time are real, but you may not have enough time and energy to make use of them. Management is often hands-off and not necessarily helpful/encouraging. Find peers to encourage and support you.</p> review1865: Management can be clueless or absent at times. It can take a lot longer to get things done than you expect.</p> review1866: Hierarchical, lots of levels of management, not a design focused company, &#034;the more features the better&#034; perspective, some copying of other startup ideas.</p> review1867: MBA/Mckinsey management takeover has depleted the entrepreneurial spirit in some groups (but not all).</p> review1868: - traffic in the morning around the main campus - no &#034;start-up&#034; feeling any more - lot&#039;s of people, lot&#039;s of projects</p> review1869: You never have a career path. You&#039;ll need months to figure out how to grad an easy number through the legacy system, needless to mention about the reviews, permissions etc.</p> review1870: Little career growth. Bas Middle management</p> review1871: almost no cons to me</p> review1872: No real cons, but you have to be very good and productive to keep the job</p> review1873: - Work may be stressful - Promotion opportunities may be limited - You may start to feel strange: highly-qualified, competent... and just one &#034;number&#034; among others - Cramped cubicles - Since about a year ago, switching groups became much more difficult. I&#039;ve been very happy at Google for the first 2-3 years (see &#034;Pros&#034;). The work could be demanding, but that was not bad, since demands were coming from other engineers eager to use my stuff and eager to report any problems, cooperate, etc. However, gradually I started to feel as if the company hires the best and brightest only to put them under a nice, but hard-working manager, whose task is to keep them busy at all times no matter what. That&#039;s where most of my work stress eventually started to come from - though maybe it was just my personal &#034;luck&#034;. I had a feeling that despite creating several successful projects, other achievements and expertise in several areas, I am not o fficially allowed any time to contemplate what to do next and what may be the best thing for me (and the company). Instead, I just have to generate code and other signs of activity every hour. That was exacerbated by the fact that since summer 2010 engineers lost their privilege to freely switch work groups. You could only go where the upper management thought there is opportunity for the company. Again, that felt like less respect to the very people who, being so bright, are supposed to also sniff where the next useful thing really is. Eventually, I left for a job at a research lab. So far I am compensated less well overall, but I am much, much more happy (for now at least :-))</p> review1873: Compensation and lack of transparency at times.</p> review1874: Engineers rule at Google. Leadership and management are weak, as these geeky guys and gals are more comfortable talking to their keyboard then to subordinates. The lack of leadership is one of the great weaknesses for this organization.</p> review1875: no issues at all whatsoever</p> review1876: There most certainly is no more glitz and glitter and many feel that Google is turning into a hasbeen compared to the innovation of new startups</p> review1877: Since the environment is one in which everyone must participate, it is difficult to pull back (e.g. girfriend breakup)</p> review1878: Not sure if it is in its peak. It will eventually going down, just like microsoft, cisco.....</p> review1879: The company is extremely large, it is hard to get to know your co-workers.</p> review1880: - Increasing numbers of middle managers who add no value - Focus on &#034;shiny&#034; vs. substantive work - you&#039;re more rewarded for style than substance, splashy work gets praise</p> review1881: Google values GPA over past work experience on new employees</p> review1882: Promotion by committee means it&#039;s harder to get recognized for an obscure project or brunt work maintaining important stuff than for working on &#039;sexy&#039; projects.</p> review1882: Not much downside. space is a problem with large growth. sometimes group compete with each other. managers are usually cool</p> review1883: Limited opportunity for vertical career growth.</p> review1884: Hard to stand out as a star when everyone is so smart and pedigreed. Also company is very big. Believe it take long time to really build reputation to be able to move ahead... but in the meantime its a lot of fun.</p> review1885: doesnt seem to be a streamlined process for training new hires</p> review1886: Challenging envirnorment. Lot of work to be done.</p> review1887: - A lot of concurrent initiatives, but unsure of status/followthrough/reasons for these initiatives - A sense that we are over-hiring - Commitment to &#034;dogfooding&#034; is admirable--but sometimes it&#039;s OK to use a non-Google application to manage some of our work. - There is a tendency to promote people who need more seasoning. Managing people is not a perk of promotion, and not everyone can be a manager.</p> review1888: not challenging enough. Should have offered a longer contract</p> review1889: Poor Career Growth Promotion review is dysfunctional</p> review1890: It grows to 30,000 employees by the end of 2011. and It starts to show similar problems as the previous big companies.</p> review1891: Ok food Disrespect from program managers</p> review1891: Competitive, demanding, and long hours</p> review1892: Your time at Google is entirely dependent on the capabilities of your manager. I worked in MTV for 4.5 years and I&#039;ve never been at a place with more inconsistent quality of managers. I reported to 6 managers during my time. A few were great, but others were horrifyingly bad. Had enough with my last manager, who was self serving and not well liked by his group, yet the company did NOTHING to remove him. Decided to chart my own course by joining a startup that was more human focused. Have not regretted my decision whatsoever. Much happier now. Too many Google managers are often the victim of their own hubris + lack of real world experience. In 2005, Google was a place where you could change things and make decisions quickly. Now, it is a place to be a cog in a giant profit machine.</p> review1893: C++ can be a pain (coming from lisp). It&#039;s good and bad that code changes so quickly that much of what one learns become rapidly obsolete -- and there&#039;s a gargantuan amount to learn, so one feels pretty inept for the first few months or more. Then again, it means things get better quickly when broken.</p> review1894: advancement opportunities stop after middle management</p> review1895: The business model has matured so there might not be much fast growth ahead. It has become a mature company just like Ebay and Microsoft. But it is still very respectable company in internet industry. Limited room for career advancement. But it seems that those without much technical skills/degree usually get promoted quickly by just pushing engineers/analysts very hard. Those who do real work get stuck at the bottom of company structure.</p> review1896: Large and growing size means your team and manager are your destiny more than Google overall Few opportunities to grow into leadership positions Some things take too long to get done now that there are so many people to consult before locking a decision</p> review1897: Company big on branding human resources w/ employees at the top of the hierarchy, and then contractors , and finally temp workers. Badges identify status with the company. Contractors and temps restricted to only work-site building/zone.</p> review1898: None that I can think of</p> review1899: as much as it does not want to be one, it is a big company and too easy for people/projects to get lost in the mix. NY Office is big, but definitely suffers form not being in Mountain View.</p> review1900: The up and down sides are there is a lot of change. Google does not get stale, that is for sure. But the processes change a lot which makes it a little less sticky than it &#034;should&#034; be, IMHO. There is a lot of social competitiveness that is very intense, but that does drive excellence, even if you do feel like your job could end any minute.</p> review1900: It&#039;s easy to become a &#034;number&#034; at Google if you don&#039;t put yourself out there. You have to be assertive and willing to throw out new ideas. That said, depending on your job role, often that can be harder than it seems.</p> review1901: The firm is big, almost too big. it no longer maintains its entreprenurial feel. But they make a good effort</p> review1902: A few things have slowed down a bit due to growth. A bit more siloed than it used to be. Of all places, the highest praise I can give is that I find very very little to complain about.</p> review1903: Slow process from idea to launch, too many hoops to run through. Infrastructure not easily transferable outside of Google.</p> review1904: Weak management; Sometimes directions are kind of random;</p> review1905: Hard to get big picture</p> review1906: Not best place to work when balancing home/work/religion. Extreme pressure to complete tasks on-time. Little time to exercise as work consumes all your time.</p> review1907: Getting political, and there is a big difference between old timers and new comers, right out of college and MBAs. They recruit for AdWords right out of college and the pay is ok-- but I think they largely get incredibly talented at a low &#034;price&#034; just b/c it&#039;s Google. If you don&#039;t have an advanced degree, you&#039;re told you can move around (and you can, title and job wise) but it&#039;s going to be lateral moves for the most part. Moving up seems virtually impossible these days.</p> review1908: Inexperienced middle managers who are where they are because they were strong individual contributors, and not necessarily strong people managers. Becoming more and more political. Lack of autonomy in your job. Decisions, even the most inconsequential, seem to be made by a few people in each department. Few career advancement opportunities. No work/life balance.</p> review1909: Heavy work load and research.</p> review1909: It too big. Not like the days of the .com. Their options are worthless. Managers want to protect their butts. benefits suck</p> review1910: Company is now very large, so it takes a while for things to happen: on the org side, and on the tech side, too.</p> review1911: I would rather be living in the south where my family is, but that isn&#039;t an option with most companies in this industry. Overall, the cons are very few.</p> review1912: There is absolutely no cons</p> review1913: ---poor middle mgmt. ---no career growth ---low salary</p> review1914: They spoil us. I&#039;m glad I worked elsewhere between college and Google, otherwise I might not realize how great of a place this is to work. I&#039;m on-call for several services for about 48 hours each month, though the pager is relatively calm. Google admittedly makes mistakes in hiring, often turning away good candidates if there&#039;s any doubt; as a result, many smart people are bitter about Google because they get turned down--but I encourage them to try again in a year or so. And if you wear Google-branded apparel in public, sometimes weirdos stop you and ask lots of bizarre questions about what it&#039;s like to work there.</p> review1915: too much stress full, always have to work hard, its like working madlly when u work and enjoying madly when u enjoy</p> review1916: nothing at all it was a great experience</p> review1917: Too many smart people at this company make it hard to stand out.</p> review1918: Lack of proper work life balance, deadlines! deadlines! deadlines! Conference calls can be weird times of the day, but overall satisfying.</p> review1918: not good some times, but especially when deadline is approaching, it would be really hard to finish everything before the deadline but you</p> review1919: The working hours are long. The pay is not worth all the time spent at work. Management is not great.</p> review1920: Start to act like a big company</p> review1921: -- work/life balance non existent</p> review1922: Size. Google is no longer a start up and inevitably bureaucracy creeps in.</p> review1923: #1- Current Recruiting practice has some very strange practices and the rather junior, mediocre recruiting staff are afraid to challenge #2-Inflexible recruiting practices that hire against a set of ideals vs business needs. At least 1,000 people a day are screened out due to ridiculous ideals that are never questioned #3-Recruiting practices that do not improve without 18 layers of approvals and weak recruiting leadership. #4-Strong recruiters leave. Mediocre recruiters stay so that they can provide more convolution to an already convoluted process.</p> review1924: unfair/ slow promotions process (if you manager really likes you you get promoted, if they sort of like you you&#039;re in purgatorium forever, if they don&#039;t you&#039;re managed out). boring work. red tape. all big company problems and more. many products competing with each other or duplicating effort. chaos in communication between teams. bureaucracy in order to get simple stuff fone. Disrespect for non-eng functions. declining quality of hires.</p> review1925: work-life balance sub-par, to shallow management hierarchy</p> review1926: Can&#039;t get anything done, so much red tape. As a Recruiter you are really just a paper shuffler and Hiring managers rule the roost so if they are incompetent then your hands are tied and there is no way to be successful. Huge company politics are in play and it is difficult to figure out who to align yourself with. If a process isn&#039;t working there is no way to effect any real change.</p> review1927: Hard to grow in your career. Lots of unattractive projects for new people. If you aren&#039;t careful, you can easily get stuck with something you don&#039;t want to do.</p> review1927: - big and complex, could move faster in some areas</p> review1928: It seems that there is somewhat shortage of clarify about people&#039;s functions over there. Overlap of work is common. But most of people are very bright working there. It seems many people care more about enhancement of PowerPoint rather than company products. Still it is a company with great potential.</p> review1929: -The hiring process is intense -A lot of information - difficult to manage it all (ironic, huh)</p> review1930: Too Engineer focused and not much thought given to internal infrastructure and operations</p> review1931: Base pay is just okay; work is not easy (very sink or swim), lots of internal procedures are always changing and often confusing; difficult to maintain a balance with so many things going on at once (a diversity/chaos of activity)</p> review1932: - Easy to feel lost in the crowd - If you&#039;re not an engineer, you&#039;re not valued as highly - Projects move slowly (huge bureaucracy) - Advancement within the company seems unusually difficult</p> review1933: pay is okay; work is not easy. lots of internal procedures are always changing and often confusing; not enough hierarchy; difficult to maintain a balance with so many things going on at once;</p> review1934: Google management is pretty bad. Many cool innovative ideas from engineers were &#034;killed&#034; by managers because they were unable to understand their importance. Projects similar to facebook and yelp were made in google long time ago and they did not start and succeed because of management failure. Top management never understood importance of social and local until very recent time. Promotion system is really bad. I was glad to get my promotions but many people are very unhappy. There is no fair system to evaluate quality and amount of your results. Basically, everything depends on your manager, he likes you, you are doing very well, he dislikes you, you are in hell. Recent privacy scandals were very embarrassing for many employees. I did not expect my company to intercept wi-fi traffic.</p> review1935: More work... not much pay..</p> review1936: unorganized no focus to individual efforts</p> review1936: As Google grows, it seems like there are hundreds of different projects going on at once. It is a bit overwhelming, but also very exciting to see that Google can foster such an open, start-up environment.</p> review1937: (1) Worklife/balance - very hard working environment. Can be a con for some. Overall the company tries to manage this as best as possible, but the reality of being in a fast-growing highly innovative company is more work than in a slower paced environment (2) Getting large/bureaucratic - for a fast moving company, it has grown up since the mid-2000s and so is more bureaucratic than say a startup but MUCH LESS than other corporates</p> review1938: Goolge has to win over it&#039;s competitors: Apple and Facebook if it is going to continue to grow and still have a stock that keeps going up!</p> review1939: Google is fighting the &#039;law of large companies&#039;, and is doing pretty well but there&#039;s a certain inevitability afoot too: Over the four years I&#039;ve been there, I&#039;ve noticed scaling back of perks (and also at times a sickening culture of employee entitlement), a steady rise of red tape to run a scalable service in the production environment, a certain amount of stiff corporate speak and a uptightness over branding, image, and in some cases (though definitely not all) an aversion to risk taking has to some extent dampened my enthusiasm a little bit. Still an amazing place to be though.</p> review1940: Needs to be run more tightly and with more focus.</p> review1941: The cons of working at Google are that if you are not an engineer, there is not as much flexibility and creativity allowed.</p> review1942: - Its is a big organization,thus takes time to understand various departments and areas - Hate to sit in cubical</p> review1943: Google has become a big company.</p> review1944: The bigger the company gets, the more difficult it is to get things done.</p> review1945: Too few opportunities. Engineers can be extremely weird here. I would recommend against this job for another tech company. Direction is vague and erratic.</p> review1945: - Middle management is very detached from work - Everything is looked from a efficiency standpoint, and sometimes that cannot be done - Indication (in ops groups) that decision is coming from the top down rather than bottom up as was tradition</p> review1946: Never get to see my product make it to launch</p> review1947: too much work and very weird hours!</p> review1948: The non-confrontational culture of Google, though generally a perk, causes some issues. Under-performance is still often ignored or poorly-addressed. Interpersonal conflicts can become passive-aggressive.</p> review1949: You must work long hours.</p> review1950: This job is sometimes stressful. I cant really say anythign else about this company that is bad. Good company overall.</p> review1951: elitism and arrogance are commonplace low promotion rate = highly competitive as company grows individual work becomes less impactful</p> review1952: all benefits at Google are provided so as to keep you at work as long as possible. Serious egotism is a problem.</p> review1953: The downside is that you&#039;ll need to take advantage of all that because you&#039;ll be so busy with work. My experience was that doing well at Google took over my life completely while I was there, requiring me to work during the shuttle ride, at work and during lunches, on the shuttle ride home, and most evenings and weekends. When I talked to other folks inside the company, many of them agreed that they had the same experience.</p> review1954: Long work hours. Lots of young people with no outside obligations to compete with.</p> review1954: Work is all about self-starting, for good or for bad. If you don&#039;t try and create your own projects or find things to do, you will end up doing the things no one wants to do. While this is good for innovation, it makes the first few months on the job suck, as you won&#039;t know enough about the baseline to innovate anything.</p> review1955: No opportunity whatsoever towards a permanent position.</p> review1956: You might get allocated to a position that is below or mismatched with your skills. Since the majority of their software engineers are PhD&#039;s, there are many PhD&#039;s doing things you don&#039;t need a PhD for -- &#034;flipping burgers&#034;. Less opportunity for career advancement; managers tend to get hired externally rather than promoted internally.</p> review1957: Sales organization is run poorly, as it contains non-sales personnel that are under-compensated. There is a bit of a cult-of-personality at the top levels (i.e. there&#039;s only one &#034;Marissa&#034; at Google).</p> review1958: so many ceilings to advancement within google. everyone is relatively young and so there is not a lot of upward mobility.</p> review1959: the hours were really inflexible and sometimes it was hard to get time off. the working conditions weren&#039;t very ideal either.</p> review1960: Gaining weight from the great food (I&#039;m +10 lbs, but working it down). Other than that, not much.</p> review1961: Company not growing as fast anymore.</p> review1962: Work life balance, demanding schedule, and hours</p> review1963: No career development / ladder / useful feedback. If you&#039;re not Eng, you&#039;re nothing. FAIR WARNING: When you realize there is more to a career than free food and you start to apply with other companies you will most likely be asked if you know how to behave yourself / act like an adult / perform in a traditional office environment.</p> review1963: The management was too far removed from our group. They really had no idea what we did or how. And they never asked. The would make power plays against each other that would adversely affect the day to day of the people working below them. There was a very strong feeling of working &#034;for&#034; them, Not &#034;With&#034; them.</p> review1964: Same work over and over</p> review1965: Hard to get converted to full-time as a contractor.</p> review1966: Big company means that jobs become very specialized It&#039;s a bit chaotic - great if you are good with change and ambiguity - but some people have a hard time Engineering is treated as a golden child so if you are in another part of the company, you are often not treated as respected or treated quite as well - that said, most perks and benefits are company-wide</p> review1967: Career advancement and promotions are vague. Job titles mean nothing -- you can be doing something someone 2 levels higher is doing, but you won&#039;t get paid the same.</p> review1968: - Most tools used are internal-only instead of open-source, so you may not gain a lot of transferrable skills. - Big company, not a lot of transparency and can&#039;t make a big impact.</p> review1969: As a ordinary employee it is difficult to see the whole picture of where your project is going.</p> review1970: The Seattle office is definitely more top down and autocratic than most other Google offices. Far less freedom to change projects and work on things that interest you.</p> review1971: too much free food, got to watch out of your weight</p> review1972: Working at Google has a stiff learning curve, and it can be challenging to ramp up and get your footing here -- especially if you have been doing software development 10+ years elsewhere and are accustomed to being a big fish. In you aren&#039;t on a very short list of luminaries (e.g. a Vint Cerf), then respect and influence have to be re-earned from scratch based on what you do at the company. Your past merits may have helped you get in the door, but inside they buy you nothing. So, to thrive here you have to grow and sustain some inspiration about what&#039;s possible, to keep your head above the daily grind of routine work. Working at Google can isolate you from the global technology community, as well as sometimes from our users. We have our own technology stack and internal lingo, so systems and methods learned here aren&#039;t always transferable. We exist in an extreme media spotlight, in highly competitive markets, dealing with sensitive information, so w e are very cautious about sharing anything externally. The culture tends to be inward facing: everything is on campus (the Googleplex) -- meals, entertainment, perk, education, tech talks -- so why engage outside of the bubble? Our approach is to solve everything with automation so that the system works on a global scale, but human-to-human customer service does not &#034;scale&#034;, and so is sometimes given short shrift.</p> review1972: * Much of the work is not interesting * Mid-level executive leadership is questionable * &#034;Death march&#034; schedules and random priority changes becoming more common * No career path from engineer to having substantive influence over what gets worked on * Too many overqualified people forced into work that&#039;s beneath their abilities</p> review1973: Work pressure is big. The company likes code better than research ideas. Research progress is slow due to the constraints on the tools.</p> review1974: to greedy company and kills all the other business and is a real hard to manage this huge company al</p> review1975: Google doesn&#039;t compete on speed -- it competes on quality. In that regard it is a lot like Blizzard. So if you&#039;re entrepreneurial and like to attack new markets this is not a good place for you.</p> review1976: the managers from my experience did not know how to manage. they seemed like former engineers that were just given the title. No leadership, guidance, or followup throughout my year there. Also when it came time to convert me to full time, management failed and &#034;forgot&#034; to submit my application. Contractors overall seemed pretty unhappy even with all the awesome company perks. It just seemed like there was just some lack of respect for us.</p> review1977: While young employees tended to feel compensated fairly for their work, peers with more experience felt salaries were low and perks were overrated. There was little opportunity for advancement in management for non-MBAs.</p> review1978: Google, fortunately, is the worst company I have ever worked for. It attracts so many talent people to work for this company, but in fact, the only give software engineers the special treatment. I&#039;ve seen so many great engineers in operation team were treated like nothing. 1. management sucks My manager is the root cause that every engineer suffers. He is the best politician I have ever seen in my life. Ever since he promoted to be a manager, he started to play all the dirty games among us. He spent $20 mil per year on some equipments which melt down network connectivity so many times every month. He claimed that the equipments would save Google for 10 millions per year, but in fact, we spent a lot more work hours on trying to solve the problems these junks caused. The main problem is, there is no test base for these junks. Aren&#039;t we supposed to test all the equipment before we implement or even purchase them? Not these junks... how does it happen? pick  ur guess! How about we go the manger above him. Too bad.. the upper manager is his buddy. There is no complain or any bad thing would ever leak out through these 2 layers of managers. They cover everything up very well. In fact, one of the manager&#039;s jobs should ensure the fairness. Well... &#034;fairness&#034; is NEVER been seen at this team. 2. politics tricks My manager has this policy: all the engineers under level III can not talk to the engineers above level IV. Well.... before I join google, I thought anyone could talk directly to anyone, even to CEO. But my manager fired a person who asked questions to a level IV. His recently move was - promoted two of his favorites to be managers and directly reported to him. You know what it means? He just promoted himself since there are two managers reporting to him now. That was the exact trick his upper manager did a couple years ago. Now... there are 3 levels of management under one director. How does this director allow  this happen?? well.. that&#039;s the politics. So, when the new engineer join the team, how many levels above him?? It&#039;s IMPOSSIBLE that you get promoted if there is one new layer added. Most likely, you got downgraded every year!! 3. STEALING/CHEATING I&#039;ve never seen so many cheating cases ever since I graduated from college, but here, at Google. We have two level IV engineers responsible for designing networks with one stealing ideas/credits from the other one&#039;s work!! And this cheating is permitted by the upper manager!! How did it happen? well... the managers playing the games. The two (now three) levels managers ensures that none of outside team could work with the talent engineer alone. When they steals, those seniors all lined up and the upper manager would give pressure down to turn in the design and the credits. Whoever on the same side of this level IV engineer would suffer a hard time and have bad reviews from those managers. So, we watched the stea ling and cheating happening every day but no one dare to say anything. &lt;to be continued&gt;</p> review1979: - managers detached, not aligned with team goals, focus on networking and their next job - chaotic, siloed organization, lots of inefficiency - sales organization is afterthought, mostly exists to patch up bad adwords user experience - so you&#039;re there to fix a problem nobody wants to admits exists. not a great career track! - i had two young MBAs as managers who both left me baffled as to what it is they did, or knew how to do. both were promoted! one sat me down in a 1:1 and told me to focus on my family and private life more, because caring too much about my job would only lead to problems because most of the issues in our department were not going to be fixed, and that&#039;s not really how you advance in your career anyway. it was good advice and all true, but it tells you something that this is what my soon-to-be-promoted boss told me. - lots of activity that has nothing to do with the company&#039;s products or business goals: events, parties, dance cla sses, on-campus organizations, etc. it&#039;s a lot like college that way. it&#039;s possible to spend A LOT of your time on tangential activities, keep getting good performance reviews (because the diversity festival or whatever is so great for google), and just hang out and make money and never impact the business. To me, this is really weird and not a plus, but a lot of people of course love it. - I left because basically I realized that if what I had achieved in the last year did not get me a promotion (major overhaul of one aspect of the business), nothing ever would. promotions aren&#039;t really about business impact at Google, they are about NOT having too much of an impact and rocking the boat. Having a dog helps a lot.</p> review1980: In finance, non-technical management somewhat helpless in technical environment. IT problems fester because leadership is detached... can&#039;t envision and implement solutions. Poorly designed internal processes lead to massive inefficiency in day-to-day operations. Culture of autonomous work is being replaced by corporate, tops-down autocracy. 20% of people in finance provide 80% of the functional value, because the other 80% of people don&#039;t have necessary technical skills to contribute.</p> review1981: No career track Bad upper management</p> review1981: 1. Too many smart people. 2. Report structure is too complicated. 3. The cube set up looks weird, no privacy at all.</p> review1982: - Too much expectations - Difficult to balance work and personal life. - Expectations too high, instant delivery is expected</p> review1983: Committee decisions very large company Too much politics</p> review1984: The base salary is just okay, but annual bonuses make up for it if you&#039;re a solid employee (ie., meeting or exceeding expectations).</p> review1985: Chaotic, lots going on all the time.</p> review1986: The environment has changed since the early days. This may just be Operations jobs and does not necessarily apply to all Engineering though. Even still it&#039;s a great job.</p> review1987: contractors are treated with disrespect. the company makes it unclear what is needed in order to transition from a contractor to a full time employee. contractors are left in the dark.</p> review1988: Promotions hard to get, process a bit opaque.</p> review1989: - You do work pretty hard. - Limited career growth opportunities. Only hire MBAs for manager positions. - Managers aren&#039;t than capable and don&#039;t understand the job. - Good to stay and learn for 4 years but you will need to leave in order to grow your career.</p> review1990: - Senior management in the weeds too much - Very silo&#039;d roles, hard to break out of your career ladder vertical - Lack of career paths, and career advice - Becoming more political over time</p> review1990: Sometimes difficult to get recognition for a job well done. Can be a little hectic on some teams, while it can be painfully slow on others. Moving from one team to another hinges on getting well known, and in some instances promoted, yet the promotion process is quite difficult to make it work for you. You may try to get promoted one year and get refused by a committee when another one would have given you the promotion, because the members of that committee were more aware of what you did or who you are.</p> review1991: It&#039;s not a small company anymore and it&#039;s easy to feel more like a number than a name. Because the change is so often and rapid, you may find yourself working for someone who did not hire you, which can be an issue.</p> review1992: Too many people full of themselves, extremely flat company structure with little or no promotion opportunities, depending on the department/product you are working on.</p> review1993: The organization is flat. Which also means that there is little room to grow. Too much free food.. can&#039;t be good.</p> review1994: Unorganized compared to other big software companies.</p> review1995: No con that I know of.</p> review1996: the hiring process is not perfect.</p> review1997: become middle age and some office politics</p> review1998: Way too many meetings (can fill half of your daily calendar), sometimes poor internal information management (getting info on an earlier project can only be done by talking to someone who may be gone for weeks, rather than any centralized info mgmt center).</p> review1999: pressure is high, tedious job</p> review1999: The working environment is not very friendly, there is an air of arrogance. The recruiting and HR processes are especially slow and tedious.</p> review2000: promotion limitations and long hours</p> review2001: business decisions are not transparently shared, the 20% is a misnomer, you dont really get that much time, bias towards profit generating products</p> review2002: It&#039;s a cross between grad school and a hundred little startups. I haven&#039;t always gotten guidance from management about what&#039;s important or how the teams need to work together. Like grad school, there&#039;s times where it does feel all your responsibility. Marketing and bigger vision sometimes comes from the product managers, but it always feels like individual advice rather than a single clear vision of where we should go. Individual teams have a lot of control over libraries and code they use, so lots of infrastructure projects grow as research projects that succeed only if adopted by significant numbers of other teams. Although there is a big vision for the company, it isn&#039;t as focused or controlled as in other companies; there&#039;s really an assumption that the right stuff will bubble up. It&#039;s not a place with the razor-focused direction. Initial titles/ranks and promotions are determined by committees of other engineers. This is gre at because you&#039;re recognized for your engineering work, but bad if you aren&#039;t churning out enough code or if you&#039;re not having enough impact on the rest of the company. Initial titles get assigned 6-12 months in when you&#039;re put in the same pool as existing Googlers who are up for promotion. If you don&#039;t match up to them, you go down a slot - no difference in salary, bonuses based on new level, and any mental scars from being judged unworthy. It doesn&#039;t really matter, but if you&#039;re at Google you&#039;re probably not used to failing. Everyone&#039;s driven to succeed. There may not be a lot of external pressure from management to pull long hours, but folks tend to do it anyway because they want to accomplish something great. It&#039;s an easy place to feel you&#039;re below average, even when you&#039;ve been tops everywhere else.</p> review2003: it is very hectic. need to keep up.</p> review2004: difficult to move to another group heirarchical needs more training for young people secretive senior management corporate philanthropy worker benefits</p> review2005: hard work, long hours, sometimes there is a lack of reognition</p> review2006: - Growth within the company is difficult unless you&#039;re prepared to sacrifice personal life and sleep, or if you got in the company early enough to manage people who can implement your ideas. - Inconsistencies in pay within grades and across tracks often make me feel my PhD wasn&#039;t worth the N years of effort.</p> review2007: The promotion structure is problematic. How you do in your core job is very undervalued in determining promotions. You can be amazing at the main part of your job, but what&#039;s prized are all the extra little projects. You&#039;d be better of neglecting your main job to take on 5 little side projects. They also tend to hire way too many people for management positions from outside rather than promoting from within. This means that it&#039;s almost impossible to get ahead.</p> review2008: Sometimes you can get overwhelmed by work in some departments.</p> review2008: -Biggest problem at Google = poor managers who lack leadership skills. My manager never once created an annual or quarterly strategic business plan. He (actually *I*) filled in the template given by management, but he never created a plan we could work toward. As a result, people did what they wanted, which was not always most profitable (in part because short term incentives don&#039;t align with long term profitability). This created a lot of problems. In 2007, the company created a new layer of middle-manager jobs and hired people internally...without training them to be managers! Disaster. Lots of inefficiency and broken promises. Horrible decision that continues to plague employees. There are some good managers, I just didn&#039;t work with any. -No career development. Minimal worthwhile training. You can take a course here and there, but when it comes to moving around the company, watch out. Sales, Engineering, and Enterprise are silos---you can&#039;t move  between them. *Everyone* complains about this. Smart people have for years been talking about leaving. -They fired most of HR in 2009 (the others have always been contract workers without benefits); what remains of HR is really weak. HR is never helpful anyway. -No one &#034;owns&#034; decisions (not even managers or their managers!), but everyone gets a say...so few risks get taken and greatness rarely evolves beyond the idea stage -There&#039;s a lot of mediocrity; why improve when improvement might require you or teammates to work a little smarter or harder? Lots of resistance to change that requires more work. -Flat organization is bad for people whose work shows skill beyond job level / area &amp; typical promotion cycles (senior management encouraged national sales team to think of lateral moves as promotions...even though you don&#039;t make more money, get better titles--and then must start the promotion journey afresh as if you had never worked there before) -Salary . When Google offered me the job, a well-known, respected web property with a similar job did as well. The latter offered me TWICE as much money as Google. Twice! And all the good benefits. -Salary increases over time. When you&#039;re promoted, you don&#039;t make all that much more. Bonuses are small (and taxed at 50%). Options are not worth as much as you think. And you don&#039;t get as much stock as you think, either. (These are taxed at 50%, too, so you don&#039;t really get very much!) All of this relates to the non-engineering side. I always really liked the engineers and when I worked with their projects found great synergies. Unfortunate the sales side made it so hard to move over!</p> review2009: - Atmosphere is rather impersonal - Hard to fit in if you are further along in your career - Teams very silo&#039;ed and x-team coordination almost impossible - Stock option packages minimal for people starting after 2006.. so not much upside there (though base/pay bonus are good). - Many old timers (pre-2004) still have lots of influence, but are no longer at top of game.</p> review2010: More and more politics over time, bad work/life balance</p> review2011: Support is limited, if you are a self-starter this will work for you. If you need lots of hands on help and coaching, continue seeking elsewhere</p> review2012: There&#039;s very little that I can think of that would constitute a downside at Google. For those looking for a startup opportunity its as close as a big company can get but still not the same thing (i.e. pitching a project at Google is a lot less stressful than pitching your business plan to a VC).</p> review2013: -Significantly different experience across teams -Very important to have a strong manager who is willing to champion your career progression, etc; often leads to situations where work is ignored if manager is busy pushing personal agenda -Strong disparity in talent at international offices; greatly insecure senior management in some teams who wouldn&#039;t mind stepping over their team members and misrepresenting info upwards</p> review2014: too many good management places taken by old per-2003 guys, no way to move over them even if you are extraordinary, little personal freedom to work on your own idea (it was the other way around 4 years ago), too much protocol,</p> review2015: There are a few people who&#039;ve grown lazy or are waiting for their stock to vest, but fortunately they are a minority and in my daily life it isn&#039;t an issue at all .. it depends a bit on the team you&#039;re on though. Also Google is the new favorite target in the press, while a huge amount of what is written is still positive it does sometime require shaking off some wildly speculating headlines and being very careful what you tell the press, if that&#039;s a part of your function.</p> review2016: sometimes a bit too much protocol...why do i need to respond to every little nuance when the company promotes austerity</p> review2017: Lack of Communication from Management Promotion/Advancement Process (360 Review plan) Lack of Process for a Company it&#039;s size Lack of training for new managers</p> review2017: - Compensation - Promotions are not transparent</p> review2018: It could suck for you if you are not a developer. If you are a developer, you never have to worry about things like squeezing out money from your products, but if you&#039;re anyone else the pressure is constantly on. The Mountain View office has the best vibe, and this vibe is missing from the other offices. Honestly, I don&#039;t care about this one but not all the fringe perks are as good as the media makes it out to be. Massages aren&#039;t free, you have to earn credits. You get one a year on your birthday and these are often given out as prizes for internal contests. Dry cleaning isn&#039;t free. Etc. You will be too busy to take advantage of all the perks. Base compensation is not great, but Google rarely lays people off. Google hires people that want to do a good job, so this isn&#039;t a place where if you have a bad quarter you are gone. You simply may be passed up for bonus, which will suck.</p> review2019: Your career growth might not be as quick as you expect.</p> review2020: Easy to get lost in the crowd, culture is a bit obsessive</p> review2021: higher pressure, deadlines, work life balance off, big company, not much mentoring, need to be hard working, lacks training and tutoring</p> review2022: less opportunity since it is a huge companies now.</p> review2023: You will face Software Engineering like interviews. They will test your ability to code and be excellent at algorithms and will be given utterly shitty job You will regret joining the company unless you are a fresh graduate student who likes to be pampered Pay is shitty as well except few lucky testers who get placed in &#034;high profile&#034; or &#034;high demand&#034; projects You will feel like a slave There is no getting out of it easily I have a degree from one of the top schools and I am already regretting joining google</p> review2024: -Tough to get new projects started</p> review2025: Too much ambiguity at times, relatively low pay, promotional structure is opaque and frustrating, engineers can be difficult to work with.</p> review2026: * Limited upside compared to a start-up. You don&#039;t come to Google thinking you&#039;re going to strike it rich in one fell swoop anymore. This is the price of stability. * Company has grown quite large. There&#039;s something intangible that changes with growth, and even getting to know everyone in your extended team can be hard. There are no all-company events anymore. These have been replaced with organization-specific events. * Management quality varies. I have a great manager but I&#039;ve heard horror stories. * Your initial project is assigned based on expressed preferences and relevant experience. It may take time to get off of it if you don&#039;t like it. * Ramp up may take some time, but don&#039;t get discouraged as this is expected. The software stack is almost all in-house and so there&#039;s indirect transfer to other systerms.</p> review2026: Reorgs every 6 months regardless of departmental needs. Getting promoted on merit is near impossible. Zombie projects are the norm. Lots of people trying to steal your ideas and backstab you for advancement opportunities.</p> review2027: Sometimes decisions are made top down with little to no involvement from middle management. Although they have peer recognition programs in place I don&#039;t think management does enough to recognize the efforts of their employees -- especially their managers. The extensive collaboration can at times drag projects out because everyone has to be involved and have their say in the project. As a larger company now -- Google seems to be far more process and structure driven -- partly out of necessity -- but it has changed the overall attitude and work environment.</p> review2028: Long hours, plus I had to work occasional weekends and holidays - didn&#039;t have much of a personal life outside of work. Also gained 15 pounds. Great place to get ahead in business, but not if you&#039;ve got different kinds of career goals.</p> review2029: no room for growth as contractor and management made many empty promises</p> review2030: -You work really hard and don&#039;t make much in comparison -Lots of people who graduated from the same school in that office</p> review2031: It&#039;s an engineering company that just happens to need sales people</p> review2032: Frequent re-organizations which can cause your career to move more laterally than vertically Many of Google&#039;s senior managers are better as individual contributors than team/group leaders</p> review2033: Some people still whine that they don&#039;t have enough extras. The workspace is very hectic and noisy. Sometimes things seem to move too fast in every direction.</p> review2034: They hire too many young overachievers - people who have only ever &#034;shown aptitude for having aptitude&#034;, as that one writer said. So it feels like half of everyone is angry about learning what being in the workforce is actually like, and shocked that you don&#039;t get promoted for working 12 hours a day and having aptitude and a great GPA.</p> review2035: Why invent one wheel when you can have four for five times the price.</p> review2035: - Not a startup anymore, starting to feel like a corporate environment - Compensation not as high as other companies in the locality - Recognition for your work is sometimes lacking - Can get lost in the sea of people</p> review2036: Unfortunately Google is a big company, so there&#039;s always red tape. How much you have to deal with it depends on which group you end up in. It can be hard to see how your project fits into the grand scheme of thing given how big the company is now.</p> review2037: Mergers and acquisitions not up to par.</p> review2038: - Base pay average, though bonus is high - low number shares of stock (plus, stock prices are low compared to peak) - Getting big and bureaucratic (e.g., launch process long and painful) - Harder to advance because of stronger peers - Minimal management attention: non-self-starters can get lost</p> review2039: No cons to complain about. The job was simple enough. The pay wasn&#039;t high enough to justify any sort of con list. I was a peon!</p> review2040: Lots of smart people, but lots of subpar people somehow managed to get hired as well. 20% time is a myth. I suppose some people get to do that. I don&#039;t know any personally as every group I&#039;ve worked with is stressed and working hard on the project they&#039;re on. At Google it was better to be early than good. Being in the wake of a mass exodus of (mostly) young millionaires (many of whose first job was Google) and being handed their mediocre work to fix can really kill your incentive to &#034;go further&#034; here, especially when later senior folks are not well compensated equity-wise. Google is a big company that provides a comfy job but none of the burning desire to go that extra mile because they aren&#039;t making the effort to take you with them.</p> review2041: Again, being a vendor instead of a Googler, is not quite as bad as being a 2nd class citizen, but it was close. I also found the group I was in to be close to complacent and risk averse.</p> review2042: Flat hierarchy, little room for career advancement</p> review2043: Not much to say here :)</p> review2044: Everyone&#039;s had the kool-aide! They are having growing pains, too. It is a terrible place to start a career, many would say.</p> review2044: The company has grown substantially during the 4+ years I&#039;ve been here. Management does a good job in trying to limit bureaucracy, but there&#039;s definitely more bureaucracy than there was 4 years ago. Also, base salaries tend to be much lower than competitors. For a company that prides itself on hiring the best, they certainly don&#039;t pay the best when it comes to base salary.</p> review2045: The company is getting really big. Products and infrastructures are huge now. Launching new products is getting really hard. Persuading people to go for a new idea can be an endless round of futile meetings. Getting promoted is harder now as the company is top heavy.</p> review2046: - Very hard to move up in the org - Too many cooks in the kitchen - Too many teams doing parallel work</p> review2047: very arrogant culture. Old-timers may have a sense of entitlement. Not much growth potential anymore unless you are politically connected with stars. Too many cooks in the kitchen. Too bottoms up, makes cross-team work potentially frustrating. Many remote offices are weak. If you work with a remote team, get ready for a bunch of &#034;C&#034; players with poor cultural fit.</p> review2048: Although promotions are said to be fair, it is all how you game the system and play the game. Don&#039;t expect to be put on amazing projects, those are for the super elite. There is a 3-4 year exit strategy here, and lately it seems its shortened to 1 to 2 years. New employees come in and realize this place isn&#039;t all that it&#039;s cracked up to be.</p> review2049: It&#039;s extremely disorganized. There&#039;s either not enough work or way too much. No feedback. No structure. It&#039;s not always clear how to contribute.</p> review2050: The hours are very long and hard, and work/life balance still needs to be improved. Management says they are doing their best to make this better, though it has not improved.</p> review2051: Relatively flat org means there are few chances for one to advance. It is not uncommon to have a senior manager with 40+ directs. There are lots of smart people. In a way, it is a good thing. The downside is that a lot of them want to play safe, which hampers innovation.</p> review2052: Job growth could be limited as company gets older. Sometimes job growth gets a bit stale.</p> review2053: A sense of entitlement from some employees With so many reports per manager, it is easy to get over looked if you don&#039;t speak up Group offices. Sometimes I really want a door and a quiet place to work</p> review2053: See review headline - &#034;Great place to work... &#034;</p> review2054: I feel sorry for some of the people who start to work at Google right out of college or academia. They are in for a rude shock when they go to other companies.</p> review2055: It&#039;s really hard to shine. As the company has grown at an amazing rate, you become a little guy amongst hundreds of strong performers. Even if you&#039;re doing well, there&#039;s probably somebody else putting in more than the extra effort. By this I mean, so many people work day and night and achieve great things, but for those who have other things going on in their lives it&#039;s just hard to compete and be noticed. It&#039;s hard to blame managers as they can&#039;t reward everybody but it&#039;s really hard to maintain a healthy work/life balance.</p> review2056: Sometimes managment has issue with letting people know to stance of the company. You will find more information if you look yourself</p> review2057: Senior management lacking the skills / experience to manage.</p> review2058: It is a very disorganized environment. The company still feels chaotic and like a start up. Also, it seems the company takes advantage of people by lowering the salary.</p> review2059: little room for upward mobility.</p> review2060: If you like working in a very structured environment then you might not like it here.</p> review2061: There is a lack of overall organization so if you like a highly structured environment it may not be the best place for you. The company is very data driven which can be a pro or a con depending on your preferences. Google is a very engineering driven company so if you are not comfortable in that type of environment then the company may not be a good fit for you.</p> review2062: * Very long hours. At least where I was, people would seriously work 12-14 hours a day (out of which 90% would be &#034;effective hours&#034;, churning away tons of code). * Peer reviews, while apparently treated seriously, are in fact a half joke. Your manager is your God. You fit with him/her, you&#039;re golden; you don&#039;t, you&#039;re dead meat. Most managers seem at least alright; however, I apparently got very unlucky. * Code reviews. I have heard many a old-time Googler complaining about the pedantry. &#034;Code review Nazis&#034; are commonplace. From discussions w/ other Googlers, it seems the transition from &#034;this doesn&#039;t break anything and doesn&#039;t embezzle funds&#034; to state-of-the-art torture has happened over the past couple years. This hurts productivity big time, and given that you&#039;re still expected to have completed a ton of work, guess what happens.. yeah, you got it: you&#039;ll leave past midnight and work from home dur ing the weekends to barely meet expectations. * The &#034;transfer to any project any time you want&#034; is an absolute myth nowadays. Caution: from informal discussions, it seems that I really got the short end of the stick, and that in other parts of Google things are much smoother. YMMV.</p> review2062: Mundane work. If you are not an engineer, you are considered back office. Surprisingly the systems have not been developed enough so you end up being the band-aid holding things together.</p> review2063: - Bureaucracy - Lack of management</p> review2064: My experience was that of an intern so it may not be typical, but I ended up doing work I had absolutely no interest in and didn&#039;t envision getting my degree for without much opportunity to do something different. When interns are recruited they don&#039;t have much of a say on what type of work they&#039;d like to do, so if you&#039;re stuck with something you don&#039;t like and want to work on more interesting things, that&#039;s what evenings and weekends are for. If you have a PhD you can do some fascinating things at Google, but if you just have an undergrad degree you might be better off at a smaller company where you will get more opportunities to do different kinds of work that span several job positions at Google.</p> review2065: - inconsistent vision. You&#039;re never quite sure what senior management is thinking, or whether they have a master plan. In fact after working there for several years you&#039;re beginning to think they don&#039;t. A lot of decisions are whim decisions. Projects get killed on a whim and resurrected on a whim - launches &amp; rollouts extremely frustrating. A lot of launch gates &amp; reviews, some are understandable but some are quite ridiculous. Too few people control too many aspects of things.</p> review2066: Big company syndrome. We have dozens of VPs and hundreds of directors. Some are good; all have their own agenda. Successfully launching something to our users is a matter of convincing the right set of people, not building a great product. Hiring bar is lower than it used to be. There are lots of great people coming in, but also plenty of mediocre and some bad hires. Company is much less transparent than it used to be.</p> review2067: Little influence on which area you get assigned to at first. Probably not much of a financial upside at this stage. Takes an extremely long time to get up to speed and feel productive.</p> review2068: Very large organization. Seemed to provide fewer job advancement opportunities than I was looking for. Little project ownership (feature ownership perhaps, but typically the project involves many many people). In my case, the project had three different managers who worked out of two different offices, leading to lots of confusion.</p> review2069: none. the food makes up for everything. the micro kitchen food is going down in quality. many chiefs, not enough indians. our battleship is becoming a bald eagle. we will fly on wings like eagles.</p> review2070: Long hours, high stress. Depending on which part of the organization you are in, expectations can be wildly different for the same job level, and promotion is a very tricky path and done by committee, and decisions from them seem arbitrary and hard to justify. It seems to have become an unwritten rule that not seeking promotion over a 2-3 year period is unacceptable.</p> review2071: The top levels of management are arrogant and inattentive. They seem to very self interested and only spout pre rehearsed, scripted answers to important questions. Promotions and reviews are based on your managers mood. The management is so flat that some managers have legions of googlers rolling up into them. This makes it very hard to stand out. The perks are there to put stars in your eyes so you won&#039;t see that there is very little opportunity for career advancement of nay note.</p> review2071: Ambiguity - it&#039;s still a young company and the transition from on-fire web start up to mature company with Q/Q responsibilities to shareholders isn&#039;t entirely clear. As a result, you have to be comfortable with an unclear career path. Management Divide - I don&#039;t feel that management involves employees further down the chain in company-level strategic decision making as much as they should.</p> review2072: For my particular part-time position, the number of hours I could work varied from week to week depending on the amount of work the company had available. Some weeks the number of hours available were pretty low. The biggest downside for me is that Google will only let you keep this job for one year. I really enjoyed the work and would still be doing it if they would let me.</p> review2073: It has grown so big that it has lost some of its culture. Career advancement is now the slow slough in any big multinational company. And late-comers might envy the people who joined earlier who got more opportunities to advance.</p> review2074: Office environment – It could be very noisy and interruptive with 5 to 10 persons sitting in one room. It’s not the best setting for strong and independent engineers to focus and develop solid code. There are such engineers in our office that hardly able to focus and be quiet for more than 30 minutes, always talk loud and flatter each other. I am annoyed and disturbed on an hourly basis. Project management: poor project management, lack of discipline and launch schedule. It’s very hard to estimate what and by when project will be launched. There is no one to enforce some discipline on code quality and stability. Launch delay quarter after quarter. When accountability finally comes and the project risks of being canceled, I see desperate launch push and poor code quality. Manager role: Managers and directors usually stay far away from daily project management duties. Manager does not know what individual software engineer is doing so don’t slightly expect s uch otherwise you will be disappointed. Majority managers are not technically strong and write zero or negligible code. Don’t expect much technical inspirations or lead by example from your manager. You will neither see much career mentoring nor other “soft” help from the manager. I had 1:1 with my previous manager maybe 3~4 times during the whole year period. Despite being the “manager” of our project, all his involvement was showing up a few times in our project meeting and later claims making big impact to the project on his self performance evaluation. Career growth: Despite the peer review model, the manager’s feedbacks appear to be what really matter. People that are vocal and suck up to their managers are very more likely to be promoted. If you are hard-working engineer that is able to and like to solve hard problems independently without making superficial noises, and expect Google to recognize your contributions, you will be very disappointed. I know som e of such solid and senior engineers; about half of them already let Google. This is very counter-intuitive given the perception people have about Google. Project and team: Google is primarily an advertisement (instead of technology) company. The web search infrastructure is awesome however only need a relatively small number of people work on that. The available projects for most people, especially in satellite offices, are limited and not technically hard-core. If you are a senior and talented engineer, you may not find a local project that allows you to focus and solve hard challenging technical problems. It also becomes harder to find other senior talented engineers that you respect and love to work on, given senior engineers are leaving and junior engineers are joining. Engineering quality: I am disappointed with the code quality of my current team. Despite Google’s code review standard and practices, too many times people hastily touch existing code or add hacky code  with no real testing. Such code checked in and deployed to data center. Overall it requires a lot more unnecessary iterations and bug fixes to stabilize the system. I don’t mind working 60 hours per week at all but it is frustrated to see most time wasted dealing with silly buggy integrated system. There is no engineering process to ensure code quality and stability or make a launch date more predictable. I see a general lack of engineering discipline and experience to implement very solid code from software engineers with no or just a few years experience.</p> review2075: Big company, enormous code base, everything is slow.</p> review2076: Its a relatively new company, so corporate ladder isn&#039;t defined. This is good and bad. You get a chance to develop your own career path, but on the flip side, you kind of have to develop your own career path if you want to get promoted. Internal promotions are slow.</p> review2077: There seems to be a lot of overhead to launching even though the company tries to foster small start-up groups. I think many small groups fragments the resource space and in some ways makes for artificial scarcities.</p> review2078: since there is alot of smart people, means that it&#039;s hard to stand out. Also, as they are smart, it means that many are also arrogant. it&#039;s not that easy to advance your career here. The &#034;big company&#034; culture is starting to take hold in this company (e.g. lots of politics and good talent leaving). Many bad managers that became managers because they were early employees. Pay is low compared to other silicon valley companies.</p> review2079: Hard to get management experience due to flat structure and now slower company growth. Highest opportunities require you to be down in Mountain View. Title deflation is also an issue since a Product Manager at Google is probably equivalent to a Group Program Manager at Microsoft and a Senior Product Manager is as accomplished as a Director at Microsoft. Most people don&#039;t know that outside of Google so it may make the post-Google job harder to land.</p> review2080: Slower growth means less chance of advancement. No more major paydays here. If you are in sales realize that Google is an engineering company and not a sales focused company.</p> review2080: Cut backs masked as &#034;being more green&#034; or &#034;complying with Mountain View&#034;. Founders are involved in just about every major launch decision and projects live or die depending on their whims.</p> review2081: food is really great and free</p> review2082: low salary compared to industry</p> review2083: A lot of people come right out of school, and they expect the world on a silver platter. New college grads got used to fresh blueberries in the morning for breakfast, and now think this is a terrible place to work without those berries, but we still get free meals! It can be a snobby atmosphere, especially in the New York office, with Ivy league grads showing off their college brands. It is somewhat pompous, especially when these bright techies lack social skills.</p> review2084: Office layout can be pretty packed (5 engineers to a office hut at times). Some projects are not as glamorous as other projects. Perks are on the decline due to the economy (but they&#039;re still pretty ridiculous relative to other places).</p> review2085: The industry changes extremely quickly.</p> review2086: One of the the things that I felt the most was most difficult to deal with at Google was the competition for promotion within the organization. While the talent of the team they have assembled at Google is second to none, it makes standing out amongst your peers that much more difficult, and it was ultimately the reason I decided to leave. Google is not the place to work if you feel like you need constant reassurance about the quality of work you&#039;re doing. Feedback from your superiors is not often given out, and a pat on the back for a job well done is simply not part of the culture, unless your accomplishments are astronomical.</p> review2087: Long work hours -- 10+ hours/day is typical for many engineers. Middle management is hit and miss. Some managers I&#039;ve worked with are excellent, others mediocre. Haven&#039;t had any managers that I thought were actively out to get me.</p> review2088: The atmosphere can be stressful, and the culture isn&#039;t for everyone. Although being a Gogoler is fun, recruiting is not the most riveting job, and promotins can be arbitrary. Good for short term, not good as a long-term career prospect.</p> review2089: Hard to get ahead, increasingly bureaucratic</p> review2089: Limited Growth potential since it is a flat organization. Google has very flat hierarchy and thus many senior people come in at a lesser job title. For example, many of my peers might have been Managers, VPs at their previous companies and now they are individual contributors and not managing or leading a team. I think Google could do a better job of improving job titles and also career progression even if it is the management of job titles. As another example, as a Sales Engineer, you could be at a level 4, 5, or 6, and still have the same job title of Sales Engineer... Maybe google should make it Associate Sales Engineer, Sales Engineer, Senior Sales Engineer.</p> review2090: Growing pains as a result of rapid growth &amp; acquisition!</p> review2091: no rewards to people acutally get the work done</p> review2092: From my four years of working at Google, I&#039;ve seen the following downsides: * In sales, management level employees tended to be hired from MBA programs rather than be promoted from within. I was not personally affected by this practice, but I witnessed the demoralizing effect this had on a good number of very high performers who would have benefitted from a performance-education program so that their level of effort and seniority would have been recognized. In addition, as is almost always the case from hiring outside management, there was a great deal of frustration from employees because the manager was completely unfamiliar with the culture and process at Google, and this resulted in a feeling of being managed by someone who learned management at Harvard or Yale. * Google &#034;over-hires&#034; people. By this, I mean that Google regularly staffs highly-qualified people in positions that are not suited to their level of education. So, for example, you woul d see software engineers being hired by support. That&#039;s just stupid. I appreciate the high standards that Google has for its employees, but I genuinely think they tend to over-correct in that regard, and this results in people not really being suited for the position into which they are hired. Sometimes it&#039;s possible for such people to migrate to other positions within the company to which they are better suited, but often this results in a level of frustration... mostly in this case people find work elsewhere, but in the mean time, this very necessary position must be filled by another hire, which then must also be trained. Not efficient, and not effective. Google also tends to focus hiring assessment on academic scores, which is entirely appropriate for new grads, but they do this even for people with multiple years in the field. That&#039;s just silly, and it actually does run contrary to the whole performance process within the company itself, where effort and  accomplishments are recognized. Thus, it makes no sense to disregard this type of assessment for new hires whose professional contribution can far outweigh their academic performance by many years. * Google encourages employee contribution to so many different projects that it is difficult for someone to get &#034;deep&#034; into a particular project and focus entirely on that effort. In this, I am speaking from my own personal experience. I feel that volume of contribution is valued at times over quality or depth of contribution. There is a sort of &#034;check list&#034; mentality where, the more bullet items you can point to, the more you are seen as a strong contributor. I think there should be more attention paid to contribution to items that are complex in nature and require more focused attention. for me, it&#039;s just frustrating, because I cannot live up to my own level of quality in my main project because of other demands from other projects.</p> review2093: Too informal on the way some workers present themselves</p> review2094: Gone are the days of a biologist being hired as a senior product manager (Salar). Now Google hires MBAs with 2 years at Proctor and Gamble or 3 years at an investment bank as our typical product hire. People that thrive on bureaucracy and build up the team. When HR is more than a few dozen people and there are both HR and Facilities vice presidents, you know that the company has gotten way too top heavy.</p> review2095: Very poorly organized. You&#039;re never sure what you should be working on or how you&#039;re doing. Everybody seems nice, but you never know what they&#039;re thinking and they don&#039;t really help you at all. People goof off a lot, so it&#039;s not a place for hard-working, intense people. My manager took off for 3 weeks a week after I got there, leaving me to figure everything out for myself.</p> review2096: Google is a large company that desperately wants to behave as a small company. Although trying to preserve many of the values that made the company great to begin with is admirable, it is also a source of headaches. The flipside of change being driven from the bottom-up is that it often seems like the strategic direction of product launches / expansions are a little half baked. The entrepreneurial culture of being quick to respond also results in a lot of chaos. Playing the politics game is also becoming an issue for promotions since there are only so many slots in a flatter organization. This will become increasingly true as the company&#039;s growth slows and less opportunities open up from expansion.</p> review2097: The lack of any coherent strategy can be extremely frustrating. The entire company just kind of wanders through the daisies as if at the whim of a couple of billionaires with attention deficit problems. Hmm. Let&#039;s buy some wireless spectrum! No, let&#039;s make a browser! Wait, let&#039;s make a phone! Let&#039;s make a wireless phone browser social network thing! That will be awesome! Be prepared for _enormous_ variance in recognition and compensation, between individuals and between projects. The sexy new project that doesn&#039;t make a dime in revenue, and everybody already wanted to work on anyway, will probably get the multi-million dollar awards. Slave away on ads for a few years and, well, you&#039;ll get the satisfaction of knowing that you&#039;re keeping the lights on for the kids playing foosball. Similarly, many complain about the &#034;low-numbered&#034; employees, which are indeed a problem. Why they stick around, I don&#039;t know. Their level  of talent runs the full spectrum, but you can usually count on them having egos and titles to match their bank accounts.</p> review2098: We are smart people - we can be more democratic with internal company spending.</p> review2098: Feedback for quality and productivity is not very good and can be downright frustrating. Google does not tell us how we are graded so it is difficult to fix whatever was wrong in the first place. Another problem is that the response time for emails is a bit long.</p> review2099: Management has spoiled us in order to become the #1 forbes rated company. Now they think we are a bunch of entitled a$$sholes. They created us... now they are unhappy with what they promised us to get to #1.</p> review2100: Siloed from many perspectives. Most people were *very* unhelpful. I guess they are all so buried in their work, they don&#039;t have time to help you. Some of this seems short-sighted since your getting up to speed will allow you to take some of their burden off, but I did not see that happen. A number of people have pointed out bad management. That is true, but in my opinion the non-existent HR is the bane of Google. I don&#039;t mean the HR folks that take care of your 401k&#039;s and administrivia; they were good to work with. I mean those who affect your career. About once a year, the director of HR for all of engineering would bring his dog-and-pony show to the googleplex and tell you how the perfs are done. The last couple of times they did these &#039;info session&#039; with themes like Harry Potter or beach party! Wonderful use of their time! When you need to reach them, you can&#039;t because you cannot find a single unblocked slot in their calendar, but  they have plenty of time to come up with these useless party schemes!</p> review2101: Echoing much of the above: weak middle management, feedback/review, and career growth potential. A young, sometimes immature company. Most of the managers are there because they were there early. And they aren&#039;t leaving. And they really don&#039;t care, since they&#039;ve already made their millions.</p> review2102: Lack of proper management, managers don&#039;t really care about employees and seem to have just gotten their jobs because they were there rather than showing any competence at actual managing. Competition between workers sometimes strains work-life balance as most are young twenty-somethings with no family to worry about or take care of - although this may change in the future, most older Googlers tend to leave instead of sticking around that environment.</p> review2103: 1) Work-aholics. Motivated employees driven to work long hours (65hrs+ per week) 2) Little opportunity for positional advancement, given flat corp culture 3) Poor managers. Philosophy is to hire great people that don&#039;t need mgmt. Need to be comfortable acting without much guidance. Little formal training. 4) Can be difficult for folks that like structure, or can&#039;t adapt to be fast paced, ever changing culture, ever changing managers....etc. 5) Helpful to be outgoing, networker...</p> review2104: -- Google is a very flat organization despite its size. As such, you really have to differentiate yourself (amongst almost universally stellar applicants) and be persistent for years before you have an opportunity to grow into an even Junior management role.</p> review2105: Flat organization has given way to more hierarchy and middle managers, who are often woefully inept. Company has an inability to deal effectively with low performers. Hard to effect change in a large organization. Lots of people are becoming risk averse and more concerned about personal ass-covering than making good software. &#034;Don&#039;t be evil&#034; is not a value shared by all at the company, especially newer hires.</p> review2106: Google is a very engineering-driven organization. At times, it seems like there are a multitude of different projects going on with very limited business coordination.</p> review2107: the culture at google makes it pretty hard to advance. the company is pretty bottom heavy and the top is controlled by a small group of lifetime googlers.</p> review2107: underpaid, interview process takes too long, the work and place is not as cool as it may seem, cutting perks and benefits</p> review2108: the culture at google makes it pretty hard to advance. the company is pretty bottom heavy and the top is controlled by a small group of lifetime googlers.</p> review2109: Promotion and career path are not clear at all. The management is not always great, particularly if you&#039;re in the Online Sales and Operations organization. The pay is very very low, despite what you may imagine (those that made a lot of money are those that were hired before the IPO)</p> review2110: The bottom up culture is fun, but sometimes it can feel a bit chaotic with a sense of duplicated effort. Since everything must function at huge scale, it can sometimes take frustratingly long to get things done. Working with very talented people can bring on a certain amount of self-inflicted pressure to be productive.</p> review2111: - You may land up in a non-important group - Industry experience is not valued, perhaps rightly so - Its hard to get promoted beyond a certain level.</p> review2112: All of the perks are designed to keep you at work longer, without additional pay. Additionally, promotion opportunities are generally available to those who kiss the right feet, not necessarily to those whom do the best work (or work the most efficiently).</p> review2113: Although my peers made the best efforts to treat me &#034;as an equal&#034;, the fact that I was a lowly *contractor* was never far from my mind. Yes, I was entitled to all the same physical privileges (massages, food, never ending snacks) but I received no other benefits (medical, 401k), and could not even gain access to internal job postings, because, well, I wasn&#039;t really a &#034;Googler&#034;. I was also not entitled to a share of the sales bonus on ANY of the campaigns I worked on, although all full-time Googlers were. But I wasn&#039;t bitter, because I was working towards something, and I had a plan. I went out of my way to prove myself, work late hours, get noticed, and although my manager did make an effort to hire me on full time, it never happened, because it was never truly made a priority. Another thing that rubbed me the wrong way was the sense of entitlement many Googlers seem to have. Complaints about food choices and other corporate decisions  were not out of the norm - I think many people have forgotten what the real world is like...</p> review2114: People really do feel entitled. I&#039;ve seen some of the pettiest, most childish and selfish behavior from Googlers. Of course they&#039;re not all like that, but it can get embarrassing to watch. Also, some groups really do behave like a bunch of college freshmen or even pre-schoolers. For people who have a few more years of experience, I doubt they will find this to be a comfortable work environment. Some people really do consider themselves to be superior to others just because they work there.</p> review2115: lots of work, stress, some workers are acting a little too arrogant and look down other new employees. It&#039;s ridiculously hard to get hired at Google. They place a premium value on your pedigree (education, GPA, even outside interests) rather than on your skills and ability to contribute on a practical level. A Stanford grad with a 4.0 GPA doesn&#039;t automatically make a better employee than a UC grad. Or even (gasp!) someone without a degree at all. There&#039;s no career path, and no career planning. I never had a good manager, much less a mentor, the entire time I was there. The people who got promoted were the ones who kissed up and knew how to play the game. Low salaries. I know there are a lot of perks to &#034;make up for it,&#034; but I&#039;d rather have the money and decide how to spend it myself. Not being a new grad fresh out of college, I didn&#039;t care about the perks.</p> review2116: Lack of respect toward other employees, domineering behavior, inappropriate initial placement in the company, extremely poor treatment of employees by management, lack of recognition, barbaric management style, unprofessionalism, sense of entitlement, and generally very poor human behavior. On my first day on the job, I was horrified to find my new manager yelling and treating me in a demeaning way in front of other employees while others simply continued to work. Many employees tend to have a false sense of confidence about their smarts and knowledge base, as evidenced by the smug and arrogant attitudes they seem to have about matters even outside of their fields of expertise. Most employees know only their limited field and role, and do not stop to consider the extent to which life exists outside of their tiny contribution, and Google itself. An extreme emphasis is placed on wealth and material possessions, such that the company culture feels empty, sterile, and  mindlessly capitalistic. Chatter around the workplace is vapid and mimics the austere, white-walled atmosphere--this is a company for kids who dare not to dream larger than owning the latest model ipod and roadbike and eventually buying that Tesla and McMansion.</p> review2116: Compensation packages are not the best. There is no formal training. You&#039;re expected to stand on your own feet and work on the problems. One needs to be extremely creative to be able to keep up to the standard.</p> review2117: Lack of respect toward other employees, domineering behavior, inappropriate initial placement in the company, extremely poor treatment of employees by management, lack of recognition, barbaric management style, unprofessionalism, sense of entitlement, and generally very poor human behavior. On my first day on the job, I was horrified to find my new manager yelling and treating me in a demeaning way in front of other employees while others simply continued to work.

Chatter around the workplace is vapid and mimics the austere, white-walled atmosphere--this is a company for kids who dare not to dream larger than owning the latest model ipod and roadbike and eventually buying that Tesla and McMansion.</p> review2118: Long hours, demeaning management, egos and elitist mentality run rampant. Because the globalization and product development is largely completed, the ability to get in and build something is mostly over. It&#039;s becoming sluggish and difficult to maneuver the sea of overachievers all wanting to be recognized.</p> review2119: Many people work very long hours, so it feels that you must do likewise in order to be considered a good employee.</p> review2120: As a software engineer you have to do many tasks, almost as running your own company within google.</p> review2121: Career advancement and career development at Google is challenging. Google is short on titles, erring to title beneath individual&#039;s experience. Navigating internal promotions is very difficult and finding the resources to set one&#039;s self up for advancement is realized only by the most political and resourceful.</p> review2122: 1. Because the peer group is so good, expectations run high, as a result many people have to put in long hours. 2. Many engineers do not seem to engage in 20% projects - they can do these only if they find time from their main projects, which, due to point 1 above, is difficult without seriously affecting work/life balance. 3. I hear that career growth within the company is challenging - if you are someone who runs after job titles, this is not the place for you - you might end up having same/similar job titles for many years.</p> review2123: Getting less googley over time.</p> review2124: stress some times quite big</p> review2125: I did feel burn out at times. I also took work home many times.</p> review2125: There isn&#039;t really a lot of room for advancement. When you start at the company, things are great, but after a couple of years you&#039;ll realize that you&#039;ll probably be stuck in the same job for a long time.</p> review2126: Senior and middle management lack vision on where to steer the group. If engineers are first-class citizens, and sales people are second-class citizens, then the folks in the datacenters are definitely the third class citizens of Google. Very immature and childish personalities. There is pretty much no growth as the career ladders are a joke. While the perks are nice, and the regular benefits are on par with most other large companies, the compensation is again, a joke (almost a slap in the face). Good people leave the group and either move out of operations and into another group within the company, or leave the company altogether as they realize there is no real career to be made there. Hiring smart and talented people and giving them mundane tasks and assignments just makes no sense. There is no real innovation to be created in operations, essentially you are a worker bee to the company.</p> review2127: Maintaining a good work/life balance can be tough, especially if you live in the city and have to make the long commute every day. The company is highly engineering-driven which means that it can be hard to bring up radical ideas; thus the company is surprisingly conservative. There are some THICK processes, in spite of the relatively flat hierarchy of the company. Some executives are untouchable, even if they&#039;re not doing a great job. And it can be hard to get traction for good ideas… Google wants the best people doing even the simplest jobs.</p> review2128: None, at all. Seriously. If anything they provide such a great work environment that I don&#039;t want to leave... ever.</p> review2129: Some functions are really un-Googley! No work-life balance. No respect for people unlike themselves (e.g. you&#039;re not an ex-consultant? you&#039;re an idiot.) Teams under the same VP are not collaborative and do a poor job of sharing information. Poor knowledge management Recognition goes to those who talk the loudest Mismatched job content expectations Hard to transfer internally Hard to grow upward Little career development support</p> review2130: The Test Engineering org. is separate from the core engineering org. making it very difficult for the test engineers to make any real impact. Most of the time the test engineering efforts go unrecognized by the executive management team. The Test Engineering organization is filled with a bunch of very incompetent managers who are very solely focused on advancing their own careers.</p> review2131: Can have long hours because you don&#039;t want to disappoint high-achieving coworkers.</p> review2132: somewhat disorganized, so you may not fit if you don&#039;t know what to do without somebody telling you grow too fast, not all employees are as high quality as before.</p> review2133: not enough coaching, lack of work life balance, not a good fit for moms with young children, performance review/calliberation is determined by a select group of peers. So, if you don&#039;t have a good relationship with such people, you can get dinged...</p> review2134: Lots of flexibility on what to work on, but the downside is that management controls the launch process. It&#039;s likely that your project may not be allowed to launch without several revisions. Engineers used to own most product decisions, but things have shifted towards product management and upper management. Nobody seems to own broad strategic decisions - there&#039;s a strategy vacuum in many product areas. Compensation is good, but obviously the equity situation doesn&#039;t compare to what you&#039;d get at a proper startup. For this reason, entrepreneurs and people with big ideas are advised to look elsewhere if they have an appetite for risk / reward.</p> review2134: It&#039;s ridiculously hard to get hired at Google. They place a premium value on your pedigree (education, GPA, even outside interests) rather than on your skills and ability to contribute on a practical level. A Stanford grad with a 4.0 GPA doesn&#039;t automatically make a better employee than a UC grad. Or even (gasp!) someone without a degree at all. There&#039;s no career path, and no career planning. I never had a good manager, much less a mentor, the entire time I was there. The people who got promoted were the ones who kissed up and knew how to play the game. Low salaries. I know there are a lot of perks to &#034;make up for it,&#034; but I&#039;d rather have the money and decide how to spend it myself. Not being a new grad fresh out of college, I didn&#039;t care about the perks.</p> review2135: If you join as a Noogler, you will enjoy the perks, free food, massage, infinite offsites, inter-grouplets, events, socials and meeting brilliant people and all that. But the moment you start thinking of promotion or career role change, you will start observing this: -- Extreme preference is given for manager feedback during performance review cycles. Some managers have no clue about the products they are managing, In such cases, employees who are more vocal and are manager suck-ups get preferential treatment during the review cycles. But engineers who make more contributions, are recognized by peers but who are not in “good books” of their direct management or a level above, get penalized. Google should fix this, and fix it NOW, before it continues scaling rapidly thereby scaling this problem with it. So many of its managers are managers just because they happened to be there when Google was 500 people company. -- You will also observe that there is very litt le or no chance of career path advancement. This is different from a start-up. If you are ambitious and you haven’t discovered what your technical passions are, best advice is to not join Google. Google makes staying and getting stuck in your job very easy. All those perks are hard to leave behind. There is a fat possibility that you are stuck doing a tiny project that has no impact, no direction and you keep working hard day after day just to realize that the project is doomed to be deleted or has no future. Best bet is to get working on projects such as infrastructure, search or ads. -- You have to be in the driver’s seat when it comes to changing projects. This used to be easier in early days. Now managers decide your fate. Manager can essentially lock you down for 18 months before “releasing” you to a different project. Google should never take its employee morale for granted, yes, even if it is the most sought after company. There are many brilliant engineers le aving Google, and these are also people with lot of unvested options. Stock isn’t a carrot anymore.</p> review2136: There is a culture of working long hours there, and 20% time is pretty much a myth now. If anything, it&#039;s 120% time. As well, the San Francisco to Mountain View commute is a little grating after a while.</p> review2137: Too much of a good thing. Work-life balance difficult to achieve; although, you can work your 80 hours a week whenever you want.</p> review2138: The company is starting to get larger, so while a lot of the entrepreneurial spirit of the original teams is still present, there is starting to be more layers of management and bureaucracy.</p> review2139: I cant think of any. The salary is not great, but competitive. Recently they are cutting down on perks.</p> review2140: If you want to be prompted sooner than the majority, and you are not lucky enough that work in a highly visible project, then you have to pay much more than usual to beat the performance of others - because others are good too.</p> review2141: disorganized; not many good managers; career path unclear</p> review2142: The salary, the internal politics, the young, clueless, and arrogant MBA managers leading more experienced people and not listening to them.</p> review2143: I did not find all of my work to be necessary. Also, my department was located somewhat far from the main campus so I didn&#039;t feel like I got to know as many people as I would have liked.</p> review2143: limited advancement opportunities .............. it used to be a better place to work but things have change a little now.</p> review2144: You get spoiled with all of the food and perks etc. There are a lot of folks in management that have excellent academic records but very little experience when it comes to actual business strategy or people management. This can hurt if you&#039;re looking to find a mentor with some real experience. Also, it&#039;s hard to get rewarded for simply being stellar at your core job. Reward is given to those who simply come up with projects for the sake of coming up with projects, which isn&#039;t necessarily best for Google or it&#039;s employees.</p> review2145: Its very easy to get used to the perks and if you join right after graduation - it keeps you stuck in college. This may not best thing in terms of future career development. You get used to the good stuff and complain for more and it can get very difficult to move on. I think the worst part is having a really good infrastructure to work with stunts your hacking skills which may not be a very good thing in general. I would advise working outside Google fro a few years and then coming back to really enjoy life :-P</p> review2146: you are nothing if you&#039;re not in engineering.</p> review2147: Very abysmal senior management. Lack of strategy, frequent changes of strategy, arbitrary success metrics. Many are in the &#034;billionaires&#034; club and have checked out without realizing it. While they claim to be nimble, too many have made their orgs top heavy and are not able to cultivate the next level of managers - too few performers are given management responsibility.</p> review2148: It&#039;s become a very large company with a lot of the bureaucratic trappings that come with growth. Google deliberately has a very high failure rate for products, so occasionally you can love an idea or product and not see it come to fruition fully. It seems like the attention span is short, and sometimes products that could be successful are prematurely shut down. Career guidance can be spotty. They purport to be very concerned with career development, but moving to another team can be like pulling teeth. I think there are a lot of arrogant people at Google, but perhaps that&#039;s how every big, popular company is or that&#039;s how really smart, talented people are. I&#039;ve heard it&#039;s worse at other companies actually which makes me terrified to ever leave Google.</p> review2149: Career progress into management is a little tough, as there&#039;s no &#034;Supervisor&#034; role, and the Managers usually have &gt;50 people reporting to them. It can be done, but it&#039;s easier to stay in the engineer track.</p> review2150: Politics have gotten worse. People have gotten more defensive in their decision making -- there&#039;s a disappointing lack of trust between employees that didn&#039;t exist in the past. We have hired too many people who are only interested in making themselves look good and have lost sight in what&#039;s best for the company as a whole, and management hasn&#039;t successfully recognized and fixed this in many cases.</p> review2151: You gotta put a lot of work in, and working with so many talented people can be intimidating. Some of the people (especially people who were here before the IPO) can be a little full of themselves (but most people are pretty down-to-earth). Also, with so many people working there, sometimes it can be easy to feel a little powerless, and you might not have the same sense of personal accomplishment that you do with a smaller startup.</p> review2152: Google has offices around the globe, from Bangalore to Zurich, but regardless of where we are, we nurture an invigorating, positive environment by hiring talented, local people who share our commitment to creating search perfection and want to have a great time doing it. Googlers thrive in small, focused teams and high-energy environments, believe in the ability of technology to change the world, and are as passionate about their lives as they are about their work. Lend a helping hand. With millions of visitors every month, Google has become an essential part of everyday life - like a good friend - connecting people with the information they need to live great lives. Life is beautiful. Being a part of something that matters and working on products in which you can believe is remarkably fulfilling. Appreciation is the best motivation, so we’ve created a fun and inspiring workspace you’ll be glad to be a part of, including on-site doctor and dentist; massage and  yoga; professional development opportunities; shoreline running trails; and plenty of snacks to get you through the day. Work and play are not mutually exclusive. It is possible to code and pass the puck at the same time</p> review2152: it is a good place for college graduates but may not be good for ambitious people. The decision to quit is difficult because of the perks, the good food, and the admires from people around you when they know you are a googler. But there is a reason for so many talent people to leave this company ...</p> review2153: As a non-engineer, your starting pay is pretty low. It&#039;s made up through bonuses and other compensation methods, but when I went to another company, it was harder to negotiate a higher pay due to my low base pay at Google. It&#039;s also starting to become a big company, so you have layers of middle management who are just a couple of years out of college and don&#039;t have the experience to manage people well. Most were great workers, but many don&#039;t understand that there&#039;s a large difference between doing your own work well and making sure that others do their work well through your guidance.</p> review2154: When you start work there they really take the time to make sure that you&#039;re trained properly so that you don&#039;t feel like a fish out of water like at other companies. The free lunches, great 401k, etc, you get large bonuses that can make the difference in a long day</p> review2155: The bottom-up management style means that some good ideas with uncharismatic boosters get buried.</p> review2156: 1. Not perfectly fair promotion process 2. Give too much opportunities to low performers (i.e. take too long time to eject low performers) 3. The company size is getting too big. 4. Salary is relatively low compared to other top software companies.</p> review2157: no management, no growth, no understanding of what you&#039;re working on and how it fits into the big picture, working on minute feature areas, working on features that generate no revenue, having to play the political game to move up the ladder</p> review2158: The people are very smart. If you&#039;re used to being a hot shot, you may not be any more. If you&#039;re looking for the startup atmosphere, well, don&#039;t, because it&#039;s gone. You will still have more autonomy than a lot of other companies, but you will not have complete control over the project you work on.</p> review2159: i think google is expanding too quickly, and that they are letting in too many people who don&#039;t meet the standards. for example, i knew an employee who claimed that they didn&#039;t have any code to show for the past several months of work because their computer&#039;s hard drives crash, yet everyone knows that no one stores code on their own computer... there are version control repositories.additionally, i know great people who have not been hired for random reasons. such as failing an interview which required coding in C over the phone...</p> review2160: As Google has grown larger over the last few years, it has hired tremendous managers, adding new layers to our corporate hierarchy. The company has hired the &#034;best of breed&#034; from many industries, allowing Google to take advantage of the extensive networks created by those individuals. These individuals are fantastic - team players, industry visionaries, thought leaders - truly an amazing set up people with whom to surround yourself. That is how I would describe the average Google employee and what they bring to the table. Not necessarily a downside. The level of mutual respect and admiration is very high here. We are all cooperative (... or should I say cooperatively competitive) as we believe it brings out the best in us and pushes us to succeed. With levels of achievement levels so high, it is difficult to see people who do succeed but who are not the Michael Phelps of their respective field.</p> review2161: Pretty chaotic sometime...super hyper growth without super structure to match.</p> review2161: There&#039;s a culture of working long hours. The company is becoming larger and larger, which results in more processes and less creativity.</p> review2162: i think google is expanding too quickly, and that they are letting in too many people who don&#039;t meet the standards. for example, i knew an employee who claimed that they didn&#039;t have any code to show for the past several months of work because their computer&#039;s hard drives crash, yet everyone knows that no one stores code on their own computer... there are version control repositories. additionally, i know great people who have not been hired for random reasons. such as failing an interview which required coding in C over the phone...</p> review2163: The days when Google was the coolest place in the world to work are gone. Google is deteriorating at the edges. Many managers at Google got their jobs just by having low employee numbers and are otherwise unqualified. Once entrenched they tend to show little concern for their reports, concerning themselves with &#034;managing up&#034; to their own manager. Google is supposed to have a project matrix where tech leads are peers, not managers, but managers commonly flout this and micromanaging is endemic. Moving between projects is limited by complex procedures and is rarely attempted. In satellite offices the selection of projects to work on is limited and to make matters worse it is discouraged for engineers to work on projects not centered in their own offices. Being friends with your manager is a more effective way to get promoted than showing competence. In fact, showing too much competence or initiative is a good way to earn the ire of your manager. Performance  evaluation is supposed to be by peer review but in reality, feedback from peers is ignored and only the manager&#039;s rating is taken seriously. Political infighting and character assassination are increasingly the norm at Google. Managers turn a blind eye to it, perhaps because they have found such techniques useful in developing their own careers. Google base compensation is on the low side, and is supposed to be more than made up for by incentive bonuses, but these are largely illusionary because few employees receive the necessary &#034;exceeds expectations&#034; performance evaluation. Managers at Google tend to consider themselves special people, better than engineers. Few will bother to greet or otherwise acknowledge the existence of anybody other than another manager if they pass them in the hall. Except for the weekly TGIF cross-company sessions where the founders candidly answer questions from all employees, management at Google is increasingly secretive about pr ocedures and plans.</p> review2164: It can feel a bit anonymous down in the gears of the giant machine. If you don&#039;t work in Engineering, you can sometimes feel like a second class citizen. Career development support for employees is almost non-existent.</p> review2165: Personality clashes and cutting back of perks.</p> review2166: All hiring is based on school status and GPA</p> review2167: Google hasn&#039;t yet grasped the benefits of telecommuting.</p> review2168: Tremendous growing pains. Not very organized in terms of career development. I&#039;ve worked for multiple managers that were technical geniuses but devoid of interest in mentoring and personal development. I&#039;ve gotten tired of commuting from San Francisco after many years. They also hired many managers from outside the company rather than promoting from within. Additionally the size is making the company less efficient as time goes by.</p> review2169: Promotions don&#039;t seem to happen too often due to the fact that there is very short chain of command and little bureaucracy.</p> review2170: VERY Entrepreneurial. You have to manage your own relationships and career, no one&#039;s going to do that for you. This can be challenging, and to some, discouraging. But take it or leave it!</p> review2170: The only downside for me is that I have an hour-long commute to get to work (but it&#039;s worth it!)</p> review2171: Working at Google can be stressful, especially during the first 6 months when you feel like you don&#039;t know anything compared to all the folks who have been there longer. The learning curve is long and steep. The environment has lots of distractions, since everyone is in shared offices or cubicles.</p> review2172: Company is getting more bureaucratic. While many engineers are super solid, some managers are only good at suck-up or manage-up, they indulge at meetings to show their influence but unable to really be a model and lead by examples. Some senior engineers are leaving as the freedom to work on innovative project is diminishing. more and more new graduate or junior engineers are hired. While politics are still relative small compare to similar size company, they are certainly growing. managers &#034;promote&#034; lots of tech lead to manage projects regardless whether they are really technically strong. peer-review process is partially broken as manager&#039;s feedback is the one that really matters. project transfer process is heavy and become very dis-encouraging.</p> review2173: it&#039;s intense -- at senior management level, I don&#039;t know many people who don&#039;t work crazy hours and still fall further and further behind</p> review2174: Not enough breakthrough work from the inside.</p> review2175: Sometimes bright people will complicate a simple problem and go into unnecessary complexity for speculative imagined reasons. Which is not desirable, makes systems unnecessarily complex. Management needs to put a roadmap before the engineer otherwise the rocket scientist engineer will starts to make the simple piece a complete rocket, which forever will need rocket scientists to maintain. Sometimes people forget the true genius is in embracing complexity only where it is needed.</p> review2176: Sometimes it feels like success is made easiest for the 20 something single people. Those of us with a family seem to be at a disadvantage. That said, I&#039;ve seen much worse, and people with a family can get ahead if they have the talent and work hard.</p> review2177: Total compensation is good, but your base salary will be low. You&#039;ll make up for it in bonus and the cost of not having to buy breakfast and lunch. You won&#039;t get the bonus if you&#039;re on leave (i.e., medical leave, maternity leave, etc) so you&#039;ll end up getting a lower slice of your total compensation than you might at some companies that provide a higher base salary. There is huge variation among managers in the sales organization. Some have no experience managing people, some have experience but still aren&#039;t good managers, and some are great. People who think up innovative new ideas are recognized and compensated better than people who do all the work to implement those ideas. Depending on where you are on the &#034;thinking up crazy new ideas&#034; scale, you this may be a downside for you. Expectations aren&#039;t clearly set in the online sales organization--you can discuss with your manager ad naseum what the expectations are, what pro jects to complete, etc. but you can never be assured of a particular reward (performance rating, bonus, promotion) for completing everything you discuss. Basically your manager can&#039;t promise you anything. This is un-motivating for me personally; you may or may not be motivated by this structure. Engineering is king at Google--you may develop an inferiority complex if you are not in engineering. They won&#039;t even give the same headphones to non-engineers as they will to engineers. I tried requesting them and was denied! Online Sales and Operations is not very flexible about work-life stuff, such as telecommuting a couple of days a month, arriving late in the morning, etc. It is fine to do it every now and again if you ask permission from your manager in advance and have a valid reason like an appointment. Engineering offers much more flexibility in this area.</p> review2178: It can be hard to advance from one level to the next Senior management can be very arrogant (I guess it&#039;s their prerogative) Everything is numbers driven, except when it&#039;s not</p> review2179: Google hires so aggressively that you don&#039;t necessarily get to meet your manager and team mates before you start. There are so many new people coming in each week that they literally can&#039;t arrange this. That is a big downside compared to other companies where you would meet your potential manager before agreeing to work there.</p> review2179: Long hours, millionaires can be difficult to work with. People outside of Google think that the company is all fun and games. Google is an aggressive company that will change the world in the next 10 years.</p> review2180: You are expected to deliver. This doesn&#039;t mean 80-hour work weeks (at least in my end of the company), but you are expected to make goals and hold yourself to them -- and ideally deliver something that beats the rest of the industry while you&#039;re at it. Do not come to Google expecting a research environment; there&#039;s plenty of research going on, but if it&#039;s not in your 20% time you&#039;d better have something to ship. I list this as a con only because I suspect this bit some of the people who rated Google negatively. The company has grown really fast. This has caused some strain, both in terms of infrastructure and in communication. Many of the nooglers are fresh out of college, and the naivety cuts both ways: they&#039;re simultaneously over-eager to re-engineer everything in sight, and bitter when perks change or they don&#039;t get promoted fast (nevermind that it&#039;s still better than the rest of the industry -- they&#039;ve never been th ere). With rapid growth comes a lack of focus, as well, with weird projects with no monetization story. (Caveat: I&#039;m in Ads, where money matters.) I get the impression that we&#039;ve got our share of bad managers. My manager (and the two immediately above him) are all great -- technically sharp, caring, and happy to get their hands dirty. But I&#039;ve heard horror stories from other teams, and you can read plenty of them on this site, I&#039;m sure -- preference for low employee numbers, suckups and yes-men, etc. I suspect most of the thoroughly bitter people have gotten a bad manager and not requested a transfer out from under him/her. On that note, Google does a bad job of handling underperformers. They try hard to help crappy engineers and managers improve, but at some point you&#039;ve got to cut your losses -- a bad employee, particularly one with a bad attitude, is poison that eats away at morale. I&#039;ve seen people go through two or more performance improvem ent plans before finally getting the much-needed axe. Google also does a fair-to-middling job of handling *overperformers*. I&#039;ve gotten a few spot bonuses for successful projects (which, to be fair, were tens of times larger than the bonuses I got at similarly-sized companies in the past), but the motivating effect of the Founder&#039;s Awards are gone. No matter how many millions of dollars you make the company, if you&#039;re not in LSE&#039;s pet segments, no Founder&#039;s Award for you -- it&#039;ll go to some guys in search or something. Google is done making millionaires -- for those of us who got who got here after the IPO, the only way we&#039;ll retire is a 401(k). Again, having worked in industry outside of Google, this makes me wistful but not angry. I don&#039;t expect other people to make me a millionare. And, finally, your family will ask you questions about everything Google related. Be prepared to have to explain dozens of times that you don&#039;t actu ally work on Search/Maps/Writely/whatever and can&#039;t fix their pet problem. :-)</p> review2181: * Easy to get sucked into working too hard * Grass roots driven efforts are less frequent then before * Bureaucracy is growing * A lot of politics for a supposedly not political space particularly senior management</p> review2182: A very flat management structure is a double edged sword, with all the good and bad you can imagine. Google also has a problem getting rid of the people who shouldn&#039;t be there, although it is getting better at it. The geek paradise can result in people doing things just to prove they are smart. The biggest complaint I&#039;ve heard from people are code reviews that get held up because you didn&#039;t use some clever idea that some reviewer comes up with at the review.</p> review2183: Your career is in your hands. One downside of little management is the fact that no one cares about your professional development. If you can manage this yourself you&#039;ll likely do well. If not, you probably won&#039;t get promoted.</p> review2184: Google is BIG! As much as they do not like admitting it, &#034;There are POLITICS at Google&#034; Much of how Google runs is based on favors or who you know. Also, there IS a developing Hierarchy at Google between the Project Managers and everybody else. Elitism is not an uncommon trait of Googlers who joined Google right out of college.</p> review2185: Its a geeks heaven, and although all employees are treated well, the engineers are clearly the favored class. I think this makes sense from a strategic perspective (I am not an engineer) but employees in sales, legal, finance etc. often feel slighted because of this. Engineers build the products that drive the success of the company, other functions are essentially support functions. This may not be the case at other companies, such as traditional enterprise software companies, where sales is more important, but that is the way it is at Google.</p> review2186: It&#039;s now a large company, with the downsides of that. It&#039;s growing and experiencing a certain amount of growing pains. Unfortunately, some people seem not to recognize that what works when a company is just a few hundred or a thousand employees doesn&#039;t necessarily work when the company grows to the size Google currently is.</p> review2187: You might not get assigned to the groups doing the really cool things. It must be very frustrating to want to do e.g. large scale graph algorithms (think maps) and be stuck doing hr programming or javascript. Though after 18 months you can move to any team you want if they need engineers (and you&#039;re performing). The infrastructure is getting complex enough that there is a huge ramp up time. While that means that it takes a while to launch a project for the first time, if you know what you&#039;re doing you can launch a very scalable project quickly.</p> review2188: The one frustrates me the most is the (lacking of) promotion opportunities. I don&#039;t think anyone who advanced well here has a balanced work-life style and I think the problem is worse for non-Eng jobs. In fact I think many people plan to leave for this reason when revenue starts turning sour and perks start to dis-appear. The second part is we have too many small projects lead by direction-less management or are duplicating efforts. This used to work well and small 20% projects may become core products. But now the company is no-longer a mid-size nor a startup, we need well-planned projects with clear directions that envision the next 3 years, not the next quarter.</p> review2188: Very hard to get promoted further from senior levels without world-shattering achievements (as there are few rungs on the career ladder); not much recognition for the indispensable jobs of maintenance and keeping things running smoothly (only drastic, revolutionary innovation is truly recognized and amply rewarded); too much love of risk-taking, too little budget control and financial discipline.</p> review2189: I spend quite a bit of time at work, but really this is mostly because I like what I&#039;m working on, and they have better snacks there than I do at home. It&#039;s almost insidious.</p> review2190: Long working hours. Rapid growth.</p> review2191: 1) Takes too long to eject incompetent people, so you might have to deal with less capable managers (not often, but sometimes)-- there are some people in the organization whose skills have not scaled with the growth of the organization, even though their responsibilities have. It would be good to have more efficient involuntary attrition.</p> review2192: Constantly changing business environment leads to very unpredictable long-term vision (e.g. what I focus on today, I know will be dramatically restructured 6 months from now)</p> review2193: Competing with many of the brightest people can be frustrating. You will not be &#034;the expert&#034; on more than one topic no matter how smart you are. Google is a big globally distributed company and we have not yet solved all the problems that follow from that.</p> review2194: Google isn&#039;t for everyone. Google isn&#039;t just a big company, it is (or very recently was) the fastest growing company in history. That growth has created some strain. Some things haven&#039;t grown to match. A lot of the finely tuned machinery (effective and appropriate management, consistent methods, best practices) that keep large, modern companies running smoothly haven&#039;t had time to develop. Because of this, there is a great deal of variation across Google. Some areas are very much like the near-mythical stories weaved by the likes of Fast Company, and others are more stagnant. This is also mirrored in Google&#039;s products - some get a lot of love and others are left to dry up from disinterest. It is possible to do well and be happy at Google, but you a) have to take the initiative to make that happen and totally own it and b) recognize that Google is a big company with lots of people - there will be friction, politics, and things that drive yo u crazy.</p> review2195: Benefits are excellent, but I think Microsoft&#039;s medical coverage is better, and Microsoft matches charitable donation up to 12,000 per year but Google only matches up to 3,000.</p> review2196: no offices. Excessive focus on engineering means that non-engineering disciplines (finance, HR, legal, marketing) are under-valued. A lot more boring ads work than you would think.</p> review2197: It *is* a big company now so prospects for huge monetary windfalls are less substantial than at a great start-up. Promotion competition is stiff in some areas, but working with great people always has that downside.</p> review2197: As the company has grown bigger, it has become more siloed--groups are segregated off into their own buildings, and inter-group communication lessens. As a result, the diversity of the people I interact with regularly has lessened by the year. The promotion process can seem arbitrary--a secret committee reviews your information and makes a decision. You receive very little feedback about the process and have no opportunity to present your case to the people who make the decision (other than by writing a &#034;self-assessment&#034; before the fact). Recently there seem to have been an increasing number of cutbacks in the name of reducing company expenditures, I suspect mostly due to the fact that company growth has exceeded revenue growth in recent years. The company has grown more faceless and bureaucratic as it has gotten bigger. It is easier to feel like a cog in a machine now than it was in the past. Many projects seem overstaffed due to the rapid growth of the  company.</p> review2198: A lot of the interesting problems and challenges have already been solved. In particular as a junior software engineer, you&#039;ll work on not so exciting tasks. Also, due to the fast growth of the company, the impact an individual makes is not as big as it used to be.</p> review2199: If you&#039;re not a idealistic liberal democrat who is born to buy in to the &#034;googly&#034; attitude then you might feel out of place here. Google seems to hire people who fit into that mold, and if you deviate then you are seen as an outsider.</p> review2200: The attempt to maintain a flat organizational structure has led to major problems with promotions, recognition, compensation, etc. There is a very real pressure to maintain the company culture and personality. Individualism is promoted in theory, yet rarely welcomed in practice.</p> review2201: The amount of things we have in our plates. The workload seems to be overwhelming now and then. Sometimes it is difficult to find the balance between you personal and professional life. But the company has been working hard in this issue to.</p> review2202: lots of work to do</p> review2203: The scope of the non-salary benefits means that salary can be less than optimal.</p> review2204: It&#039;s a balance, but sometimes lack of structure and processes is a hindrance to getting things done. Flat-ish organization leaves less room for traditional personal promotion.</p> review2205: The side-effect of everyone being good (and everyone else knowing it) is that there is a lot of pressure to not disappoint anyone. The side-effect of less management is that feedback is hard to get and good performance and hard work can go unnoticed and unappreciated. A focus on technical expertise means that there is less focus on soft skills. Many managers are not good enough at managing people even though they are very good with the technical side of things. Culture encourages one to give up the rest of his/her life for their job. Despite the initial utopian feel and propaganda, it&#039;s just a really rich company with a lot of smart people. It still IS a company and has the same stupid politics, competitiveness, and issues you find everywhere else.</p> review2206: Not many I can think of</p> review2206: The only downside for me when working at Google was the long commute. Coming from north of Mountain View down the 101 South is usually congested with traffic. All the hours spent in traffic adds up and does take it&#039;s toll on you.</p> review2207: It is now a huge machine, a very political environment and very low salaries compared to competitors. Also, there are people there from the pre-IPO days who are only nice to their &#034;inner circle&#034; and should take their millions and go away!</p> review2208: Google is big, so your impact often seems tiny with regard to the company as a whole. Things are gradually getting more and more bureaucratic, the pain of being a public company with profits to protect. You gradually feel less and less important to the company as time goes on, as the company grows to many 10s of thousands of employees. Things like the Founder&#039;s Awards, which originally were supposed to be motivating factors to great products could end up being demotivating for many. For example, if you are stuck on a project that is in maintenance mode, or if you launch a great product that is overlooked, you might have little motivation to work hard again.</p> review2209: Google is big, so your impact often seems tiny with regard to the company as a whole. Things are gradually getting more and more bureaucratic, the pain of being a public company with profits to protect. You gradually feel less and less important to the company as time goes on, as the company grows to many 10s of thousands of employees.</p> review2210: In the sales organization, there is a pervading sense of hopelessness. Almost everyone knows that there is no true hope for career advancement. In fact, there is not even a concrete career path for most in the organization. Management in the sales organization is poor, with an influx of MBA managers coming in and trying to dictate how to run the organization without much background or knowledge of how the department works. Morale is at an all-time low within the sales org, with employees frustrated that they&#039;ve hit the invisible but definite glass ceiling for promotions. One of the biggest problems in the sales org is that Google hires the best and brightest -- from the Ivies and other name-brand schools -- and gives them a job to do that high school graduates alone could perform. This leaves a bunch of smart and disillusioned employees wondering how they entered the organization in the first place. Finally, but quite importantly, it&#039;s crystal clear to a ll Googlers that the company values the engineering side of the company and treats non-engineering employees like second-class citizens.</p> review2211: There is a sense of intense oversight at Google where every move is analyzed. Plus, if you are not based in Mountain View then you are a second class citizen.</p> review2212: Think twice before selling your startup to Google.</p> review2213: I believe that the quality of the middle management leaves a lot to be desired. I find the quality of middle managers to be extremely variable. I believe some managers do not actively contribute to a good outcome for the team. Also, I believe that Google is not good at weeding out those managers who do not perform well. Google&#039;s &#034;slotting&#034; process is terrible. I know many instances of people who have applied for positions that interest them, only to be &#034;slotted&#034; into positions which they do not like. Once you are slotted, it is very difficult to move out of your position. It could take months, maybe even a year or so. Also, these same middle managers have sole control over your quarterly evaluation. These evaluations feed into your annual bonus, so if you are incorrectly slotted and do not perform to the best of your abilities, then you are triply penalized: your evaluations will be poor, your bonus will go down and it will become harder f or you to transfer to another team.</p> review2214: Long hours! Not the place for people who want to have a life outside of work, but then they aren&#039;t the type who wind up getting hired anyway.</p> review2215: Inexperienced, low EQ, and inept middle managers. Hubris no doubt fueled by the hype surrounding everything coming out of Google these days. The internal class system (pre-IPO vs. post-IPO, or engineers vs. everyone else)</p> review2215: The hiring process is completely skewed towards academics so we are limited to the types of people we can hire and too often we end up hiring people with low &#039;EQ&#039; who just can&#039;t function in a coporate environment.</p> review2216: Like many of my peers who have commented in this site, it&#039;s elitist. It bothers the hell out of me that someone who could only afford a community college but yet is likely an excellent account executive gets rejected.</p> review2217: Large corporations have a certain bureaucracy and more red tape than startups, naturally. Promotions at Google require either someone to nominate you (rare) or self-nomination during regular performance review cycles. Performance review cycles are a big pain and context interrupt. Many share this view though it is believed to be a necessary evil.</p> review2218: I got pretty chubby, but that&#039;s my own fault. The brutal interview process means people who work there all think they&#039;re hot stuff even if they aren&#039;t. Downright obnoxious people work there, there are no standards for managers. Everyone is working on 5 projects so nobody pays attention to everything they need to. Ultra-competitive, passive-aggressive culture.</p> review2219: Politics at the senior management level</p> review2220: Things move very quickly and change so often that you sometimes become weary of it. Lots of growth and associated chaos in middle management in the last 2 years has had a big, mostly negative, effect on the culture. The company is slowly but surely losing it&#039;s quirky culture and feels more &#034;corporate&#034; each day.</p> review2221: lack of management feedback and direction, long hours</p> review2222: Well, my salary is not particularly high.. Some of the perks listed are just subsidized, and some are not even that. Also, there seems to be a slight trend toward money-oriented decision making, slowly eroding Google&#039;s &#039;Googliness&#039; factor.</p> review2223: One of the most &#034;politically&#034; divisive cultures you will ever work in. If you have ever dreamed of working in a company where you are rarely held accountable for anything, Google is the place to be. The 6 hour days, the inexperienced managers, the joy in reinventing the wheel, the ability to destroy a co-worker by the mere mention of being &#034;un-Googly&#034; (In the years I worked at Google I still haven&#039;t the slightest idea what &#034;Googly&#034; means. I never met one single right-arm leg spin bowler while I was there). The bottom line is that Google is NOT the same company it used to be and yet the myth lives on.</p> review2224: The base salary and lack of promotion opportunities really start to wear down employee morale after the first few years. Unfortunately, there&#039;s too many glassy-eyed Google cultists/lifers who are willing to overwork themselves for a 35% (or more) paycut on projects that may not actually go anywhere. Despite claiming to seek openness, management keeps a lot of secrets-- especially around performance reviews (all employees are graded and rank-ordered, but employees don&#039;t get to know how well they fared). In terms of actual productive work, employees are demoralized by having direction constantly changed. I suppose this is known as &#034;keeping us on our toes.&#034; Further, it&#039;s tiring to hear every team say that they&#039;re acting as their own startup within Google, and that team members are going to be hand-picked to be involved in such a prestigious project. It&#039;s not uncommon for entire teams to be uprooted or replaced in one fell swoop. Put  together, this leads to an uneasy feeling about one&#039;s job stability. One final problem: too many Googlers are young, inexperienced, and short-sighted in their understanding of how much power they actually have in developing public-facing products. They don&#039;t understand the implications of their actions, and move too quickly to consider them.</p> review2224: The founders often change their minds, causing teams to scramble. They don&#039;t seem to care about the damage they cause as a result.</p> review2225: Project scheduling was pretty haphazard Inter-team communication was also pretty haphazard You were often working with people all over the world, which sounds fantastic at first until you spend DAYS in video conference meetings Inept, Overworked managers (70 or 80 direct reports for someone who had never managed anyone before was normal) distant, ineffective HR (NYC office had 1 HR person for 1000+ employees in the office and was not authorized to do anything except send problems to Mountain View)</p> review2226: -Lack of good managers -Very little promotion from within and internal movement -In more non-engineering focused roles, its more about how much you talk versus your results (I have seen many people who are actually not that great be promoted because they knew how to talk to the right people)</p> review2227: It&#039;s a monster, flat organization doesn&#039;t allow for much advancement.</p> review2228: Certainly it&#039;s a big company. It tries hard to not be. It tries to rekindle some of the old things that made it unique, but it seems like a lost cause for the most part. There is much less opportunity to shoot to the top. There is less and less exposure to people outside your organization and too far above your management chain. There is a lot of work to be done, and Google is pretty cheap about the way that work gets accomplished. It puts added burden on many people including engineers and lower level managers. Getting actual things accomplished and seeing how it fits into the company goals has been hard.</p> review2229: Most of the Googlers have only been working for 1 or 2 years in Google. Still very young company. High turn over after stock option exercised.</p> review2230: As the company grows, more and more groups compete for the attention of senior management, which has continued to keep a tight grasp on the operations of the company. It becomes very difficult to operate strategically, as the opportunities for high-level feedback are few and far between. And on those occasions that you do have the opportunity to solicit feedback, it&#039;s generally very disruptive and can often times be untimely or driven by subjective factors. To management&#039;s credit, this &#034;sparse micromanagement&#034; is an acknowledged problem, and more and more senior managers at the director level are taking ownership of large strategic initiatives. As the company starts to transform its leadership culture, there will be interesting changes in the way products are developed, from charter through launch.</p> review2231: Google is starting to feel like a big company. The number of times org charts appear in meetings is constantly increasing. There is a growing necessity to deal with politics in order to promote projects and get recognition. It is getting harder to innovate in the core parts of the business.</p> review2232: Extremely competitive. Incredibly high bar set for performance.</p> review2233: In order to excel,you must give up most of your social life to compete with people willing to spend more than 10+ hours a day at work. Its not the fun company it used to be, I may be a little jaded since I was there in the early days, but its become more like Microsoft, and the &#034;Google culture&#034; is more of a fable these days. Google buys technology these days, and does not innovate from within.</p> review2233: Lots ! 1. We only say that we have free food, and all other crap, how does it help me as a person ? 2. Peers are arrogant, and i have seen its like stanford etc are great .. (ps i am from stanford too though), but the general attitude around is like every other place is bad .. 3. recruitment process is not good, though i did get it due to my background, i dont think they see skillsets, they see only background. 4. An air of arrogance ... 5. Too competitive -- good for people who have nothing better in life except work ! (yes sort of geeks .. and geeks SUCK isnt it ..)</p> review2234: Sometimes there is too much work to be done. It would be nice to have some breathing room to be able to do side projects, etc. Sometimes I feel a little lost in the large company.</p> review2235: Google is still a corporation, and there are some managers who don&#039;t fit well within the culture. Since they play down titles, and the organizational structure is flat, micro managers kill morale.</p> review2236: It&#039;s very competitive and it&#039;s getting too big.</p> review2237: While the flat structure aids quick development of ideas, many managers are not people persons and are fairly inexperienced (as managers, while they&#039;re great software engineers). For newbies this can be frustrating because of the lack of downwards managerial communication. On top of that, the lack of clear policies and rules about things like WFH and OOO while make it easier to have a personal life highlight the disparity between well-connected Googlers (who might be friends with their managers) and the others. Lastly, product/project managers, ubertechs and swengs often fight about silly stuff, leaving innocent bystanders merely confused.</p> review2238: Massive pressure to perform to the level of your peers, to the level of legendary figures who have gone before, and to the levels required to keep the dollar generating machinery running. Also, Management, communication and other people skills are not favored in Engineering. The results are predictably enough that technically competent engineers who demonstrate good results, get management responsibilities that they fit in between technical work. Those that have the people skills don&#039;t get these promotions. I have not personally suffered from this so this analysis is not sour grapes. I have seen women who are already doing the project management role out of necessity as well as their own technical load, get passed over for promotion even though the projects they are on succeed, because they can&#039;t point to high personal metrics due to their unrecognized management load.</p> review2239: The larger the company gets, the more the culture becomes dilute. The past year or two has brought extensive change in terms of management hierarchy to certain area of the company. With the hiring or more and more managers from the outside, the company has lost some of its democratic idealism in favor of traditional corporate politics. Google is now a very large company, and it&#039;s hard to avoid all of the downsides that accompany such size. It can also be very difficult to find a career path at Google. Promotions are exceptionally rare. Despite the fact that employees can theoretically excel in both individual contributor and management tracks, there is still a feeling that the only way to climb the corporate ladder is to become a manager. It&#039;s also the case that people are often promoted into management roles without the necessary skills and training, leading to poor relationships between teams and leaders. It also becomes more and more difficult to make  fast progress on projects as the company gets larger. Google is still very nimble compared to most large companies, but it&#039;s no longer a scrappy startup unencumbered by size.</p> review2240: This is no longer a startup. You can&#039;t expect to go to Google these days and become a millionaire. As some reviewers have said, there is basically no room for advancement so it is a deadend job. They do discriminate by schools. Say if you attended Arizona State you would get paid $20k less than the same person graduating from Berkeley or Stanford. It is pretty ridiculous like that.</p> review2241: Long work hours Flat organizational structure Compensation is much lower than competition</p> review2242: The downsides of working at Google depend largely on the department that you&#039;re dealing with. The sales organization is highly disorganized and has a glut of middle management. Management and structure are obviously necessary in all companies, but the sales org at Google has too many managers, many of whom are ill-qualified to be managing other people. There are also a lot of politics surrounding promotions, etc. because of this large middle management structure. It also causes a lot of unnecessary bureaucracy which slows down work and can be extremely frustrating for individuals who are still on the lower rungs of the ladder. Additionally, at least within the sales org, there appears to be virtually no real career path or hope for development/promotion. Managers are hired from outside (with MBAs being strongly preferred), which is frustrating and demoralizing for employees who have worked for years without being moved up.</p> review2242: If you enjoy your individuality and time alone, Google is not the place for you (keep in mind I’m not an engineer). Google pushes a highly &#034;googley&#034; atmosphere, which is something akin to what the Brady Bunch would be like if they lived in communist Russia. Everything from the carpet to the bathroom tiles incorporate the Google colors into its design. People are encouraged to have googley attitudes, wear plastic smiles, and not to question the infallible nature of the executive management group. Marathon hours are the standard because, after all, employees are practically encouraged to bring a cot and sleep there…barracks coming soon (really?! no, not really). If you like feeling awkward during forced group activity, Google is your haven. It isn&#039;t exactly &#034;forced&#034; (no guns), but if you don&#039;t participate you become labeled as &#034;ungoogley.&#034; Once deemed “ungoogley”, you&#039;re practically viewed as a rotten apple that t hreatens to spoil the bunch. If you can endure and appreciate the googley atmosphere, you might also enjoy Google&#039;s uncanny ability to clot information within the hierarchy. Very little is shared throughout the company because from the moment you&#039;re hired, secrecy is revered. But to be honest, most of those who read this review won&#039;t even be able to get a job there. Whether you&#039;re right out of college or are putting your kids through college, your academic standing will be asked about, your transcripts required. If you went to Podunk U, your chances are worse than the rumored 1% of applicants. I&#039;m not saying that high standards aren&#039;t important, but Google discriminates against creative and diverse applicants by employing such arbitrary standards. Google (generally) hires the elite who have elitist attitudes…probably not the best way to understand what the masses want.</p> review2243: Company is not too big. Has lost much of it&#039;s small company feel/culture. Much tougher to make decisions and many layers of management. Company hires too many people with same backgrounds - all ivy league MBA, competitive, ego-driven managers that has changed the culture.</p> review2244: We&#039;re stuck in cubicles. (Before Google, I worked at Microsoft, and at MSFT everyone gets their own office, or at least, every engineer...) The stock price is variable, so if you join and the stock&#039;s at 700, and then the stock goes down to 500, you may end up resenting the people who just got hired and have an option strike price $200 lower than you.</p> review2245: Google is getting big. This means a couple things: It&#039;s no longer always a &#034;startup&#034; feel. There&#039;s a lot of teams, and a lot of infrastructure, and there&#039;s starting to be a bit of bureaucracy here and there (though management has done a pretty good job killing it on sight whenever they see it). Also, because we have a lot of users and are always in the limelight, we have to be really careful about launching things, which often means that launching something requires jumping through more hoops to make sure it&#039;s scalable and stable, and that all the i&#039;s are dotted and t&#039;s are crossed, in order to not have a bad press situation or an emergency caused by an overloaded system. This is good for production launches, but can slow down experimentation in the early stages of a product.</p> review2246: lack of growth opportunities at google</p> review2247: Because of the large amounts of benefits (such as free foods) there seems to be an unsaid rule that employees are expected to work longer hours. Many people work more than 8 hours a day and then will be on email or work for a couple hours at home, at night as well (or on the weekends). It may be hard to perform extremely well with a good work/life balance.</p> review2248: If you aren&#039;t technical there is nowhere for you to go professionally. Basically, they hire really smart people and dont&#039; tell them they are putting them in a dead end job. There really isn&#039;t much possibility for movement, and the job ends up consuming 90% of your time for average pay. Its kind of a scam.</p> review2249: Team Leads were often inexperienced and poor. They were not use to working with so many high achievers and did a poor job managing them. Often had issues of micro management. The salary was average to below average depending on what department you were working for.</p> review2250: For entrepreneurial people that want to start their own company, working at Google can become very comfortable and you enjoy a lot of the learning you would as if you were in a tech startup, thus prompting you to stay as an &#034;employee&#034; instead of business owner.</p> review2251: Too much of an approval process. They don&#039;t really care much about web standards. They write horrible HTML code.</p> review2251: Can&#039;t think of any right now</p> review2252: Well, this is a young company, so there are lots of internal changes. This is to be expected, but for me it is a negative.</p> review2253: It is very unstructured. No one is teaching you what to do, you have to learn on your own. However, there are tons of smart people to ask who are willing to help.</p> review2254: A directionless job and also a tremendous amount of work which is sometimes meaningless due to the constant change in direction.</p> review2255: No cons to share at this time.</p> review2256: No cons at this time.</p> review2257: The company is growing fast and it is easy to imagine that there will possibly be some growing pains in the future.</p> review2258: No cons at this time.</p> review2259: Sometimes people need to realize when we work with other companies they may not work at the same speed as Google. So their expectations are often skewed.</p> review2260: One thing that is a negative aspect for me here is that sometimes my job at Google can be repetitive.</p> review2260: There is a lot of stress here and I think it is a result of the growth of the company.</p> review2261: Sometimes being that it is such a big company it is sometimes hard to be heard when you need to voice concerns or comments.</p> review2262: A company like this requires a lot of long hours, so the work and life balance is often hard to come by.</p> review2263: This seems like not a very big con, but to tell you the truth the parking lot here is always crowded.</p> review2264: It is very difficult to know where management is headed. Over all there is more bureaucracy than there used to be. Not as nimble as I would like</p> review2265: Google can be a bit overwhelming w/ the volume of things that you have to learn. It can also be chaotic because you do have freedom but so much is always going on at the same time.</p> review2266: - most of the people grew within the company, so it&#039;s hard to learn anything new - for the same reason senior management is not 100% knowledgeable and the company sometimes lacks strategy and vision that it&#039;s good to get from the outside</p> review2267: Lots of pressure to deliver, little sleep,</p> review2268: nothing i could find, but the timings changed very frequently, sometimes morning and sometimes afternoon. but, not much difficulty faced overall a very good company.</p> review2269: Hard to rise up the ranks Time consuming</p> review2269: lots of stress, cannot change teams easily, hard interviews.</p> review2270: Not any one that comes to my mind</p> review2271: to always being a straight forward and easily trust someone. i do not like to much talk</p> review2272: Hard Work and long hours</p> review2273: You have no time left for yourself and forget about any lifestyle. Useless travels all the time.</p> review2274: I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve ever had a problem in using any app or anything else that is available from google</p> review2275: flat organization with somewhat limited promotion opportunities</p> review2276: Not always a door opener for FTE</p> review2277: there are no cons really. its great working here</p> review2278: So far, can not say about any cons</p> review2278: systems sometimes not caught up with the execute and deliver fast mentality</p> review2279: No innovation, bureaucracy, internal politics.</p> review2280: Became hierarchical and rather McKinsey-like.</p> review2281: chance to make a major career move</p> review2282: Pay was weak compared to other offers</p> review2283: Too large, bureaucratic at times, large cashflow makes people focus on the wrong things sometimes. It used to hire just the best of the best, but given its size, this is not always the case anymore.</p> review2284: Poorly trained management team, seriously, they promoted in the past sales people to management, and they aren&#039;t good with people skills.</p> review2285: Not much cons. Many interns.</p> review2286: In negar future i going to create a good web site</p> review2287: Google is constantly growing and restructuring. It started as a start-up and now a massive multi-billion dollar business. This transition has raised concerns on preserving the culture and Googleyness amidst the need to grow.</p> review2287: long hours, not for everybody</p> review2288: very flat hierarchy, harder to grow inside the company. not many option for non swe other than that is perfect</p> review2289: Nothing really. Everybody employed is very nice and polite, its a great change from the average office cubicle job.</p> review2290: Google does not consider the people from third world</p> review2291: Strict hours Better benefits have been offered by other companies Salary was unreasonable for the amount of work expected You are expected to work in a tiny cubicle, lack of promotions throughout the company.</p> review2292: Most of the cons i think was very specific for me and I don&#039;t think that they are general cases. - Once I started there was no project for me, and I choose my project with my mentor when we were taking a walk after a fake fire alarm in the building :) - I was working alone in my project with my mentor. So I missed working a team there! - I didn&#039;t take any training at the beginning and I started in the project my mentor and I chose.</p> review2293: Google has grown a lot and in the business side, it is not the scrappy risk averse start up it used to be. With growth strict processes have obviously been put in place, which means that it&#039;s harder now to try out new things.</p> review2294: The only con that I can think of is that I&#039;m only an intern-- can&#039;t wait for the opportunity to become a full timer!</p> review2295: Big egos, lots of brilliant technical guys who happen to be sucky managers, little regard for accomplishments outside the company (i.e. industry certifications), good people management in Engineering is still taboo (managers not interested in good people mgmt practices). Such a dynamic environment that feels like walking on quicksand, change fatigue quite common.</p> review2296: - Multiplication of &#034;Middle manager&#034; - People&#039;s development politics tend to decline</p> review2296: Work load - Professional No friends culture</p> review2297: a bit stifled as far as involvement for lower level employees, would like to have more opportunities to contribute strategically and on different projects</p> review2298: Good place to develop your self.</p> review2299: none .</p> review2300: You can lose all work life balance if not careful.</p> review2301: At the mid level there can be lots of politics and some less competent people seem to be able to hang around mid-level positions forever. Can feel quite corporate there.</p> review2302: Can&#039;t think of many to be honest</p> review2303: -it&#039;s a corporate, so quite some top-down management -less career opportunities in small office</p> review2304: You need to review porn pictures and words for 8 hours every day. You can only develop super domain specific knowledge.</p> review2305: Nothing really to think of</p> review2305: nothing I can think of.</p> review2306: long project to finish sometimes</p> review2307: Lack of focus in core business area Way too many reorgs at senior level Employee benefits starting to diminish in quality</p> review2308: Massive amounts of entitlement, lack of diversity, ambiguous objectives, highly political &amp; competitive, long hours. Working in a distributed offices offers less career development until you move to MTV, NYC or LON. Quality of managers varies greatly.</p> review2309: Google company is a good company and you will on you huge diversity of work managing from defining independent journalism worldwide. Best machine learning experts project. And as you can see it like in maps. Try it. Thank you</p> review2310: Career prospect depends on mid-management which at times can be a bottle neck</p> review2311: nothing much technical.Anyone good with using their API tools can do it.</p> review2312: * Remote office as Bangalore is only cone</p> review2313: Difficult to adjust to other company&#039;s culture</p> review2314: Poor Performance Review System (and I am doing well within it so not bitter)</p> review2314: 1. Long work hours (though flexible) 2. Few career paths in India 3. Every few years work-model is repeated</p> review2315: If you start junior it&#039;s very hard to get significant steps up in salary without getting counter offers from competitors. It was one of these counter offers that caused me to leave Google. As Google has matured there&#039;s been too much emphasis on sales operations to lead the charge.</p> review2316: - Large organization - makes it hard to see the impact of what you do on a daily basis.</p> review2317: Have nothing special to say, really. Maybe the difference between badges...</p> review2318: Indian employees are not treated the same as USemployees</p> review2319: Care about good ideas, but didn&#039;t pay much attention to the delivery. Local branch is not as open as headquarter.</p> review2320: Not that great work profiles. Non-transferable skill sets. Adwords focused jobs. Really hectic work.</p> review2321: need a proper guidance for work with</p> review2322: Google will let you balance your life, but unless you&#039;re really good, expectations are high and a lot of overtime will be needed to reach up the ladder. Google won&#039;t force you, but it is still a meritocracy.</p> review2323: career growth is limited if not an engineer.</p> review2323: All are good no cons</p> review2324: It&#039;s a lot of hard work for clients</p> review2325: The people are smarter than you</p> review2326: Difficult to expedite your growth trajectory as you are working with smartest people</p> review2327: Not always your work is recognized and as a consequense you have a chance to lost your further opportunities after the internship.</p> review2328: The work as an intern is not the greatest.</p> review2329: Need to serve more food that is bad for you ;-)</p> review2330: The tacos give you gas.</p> review2331: Salary low compared to other global offices but still competetive for Ireland</p> review2332: I can&#039;t think of any</p> review2332: I can&#039;t think of any</p> review2333: maybe some boring work? just maybe</p> review2334: Intimidation from being surrounded by incredibly bright people.</p> review2335: The interviews are quite tough, and most of the time, employees are working their minds off. But yes, obviously to achieve something great! Not too many cons to offer!</p> review2336: It is becoming too big and too much on the process rather than the results. Too much politics in the MENA office this is why they are loosing great people.</p> review2337: Roles All of the roles are backend or the lowest in the pecking order - from product management to advertising operations. Job descriptions are not an accurate reflection of the actual day to day job and often glorified. Management is highly mediocre An MBA from a top tier school does not give common sense to the manager or a sense of empathy for employees. Limited vertical growth - My time witnessed one reorg and two relevels. The re org reset my rating and I was told by HR I was lucky to hold on to my job, even though there were plenty of openings/hirings occurring at the time. The relevels bridged the gap by promoting all my juniors (many of them Freshers and only undergraduate degree holders), while the rest of us continued to remain at the same levels. There was no formal communication on this and approaching HR resulted in nothing but eyewash. Poor cash comp The take home component of the job is pretty low - given the way the salary is structured - hits you  when you seek employment elsewhere. HR conveniently includes the stock as part of the package provided, but when you sign the agreement it clearly states that ESOPs should not be considered as part of the comp plan.</p> review2338: Might be too big for fast career development.</p> review2339: Not a whole lot of downsides though I suppose people who have been there a while might feel greater pressure to pull longer hours etc. Work can become your life a bit, often just because you let it.</p> review2340: Sometimes the shifts used to have crazy times. And the shift rotations are very abrupt. Workload can be a little more efficiently managed though.</p> review2341: Competing with so many talented people.</p> review2341: work from home it is not always easy</p> review2342: If I ever lost my job I would not be able to find anything else as good in Montreal.</p> review2343: Getting selected post intern also involves interviews</p> review2344: Very large and complex business so it can be hard to identify the right stakeholders and to communicate effectively.</p> review2345: Google sometimes hires over qualified people that get frustrated by doing operational work.</p> review2346: Depending on the department you&#039;re in, its a very managed process, employees have one central function in the process, role can be repetitive. Employees really believe there are the superstars of the industry, they is a certain arrogance with how they other companies. The culture is bordering on a religion which isn&#039;t healty, its a job at the end of the day!</p> review2347: Yes, there are a lot of fish in the tank and you will maybe start a level below where you would start in another company and yes you may do jobs that you feel overqualified for, but ultimately, if you are good, you will succeed.</p> review2348: I think you need to work too long to have a high salary</p> review2349: too much politics which is frustrating</p> review2350: You need to always ready to accepting new 10X challenge every quarter in Sales and BD.</p> review2350: ruthless corporate culture, unrealistic growth targets, arrogance</p> review2351: Salary not in relation to level of work expected. Nearly too much equal opportunity</p> review2352: None that I see working here</p> review2353: Growing larger and larger and quickly losing its start up feel, family culture and time to work on other projects.</p> review2354: - None so far, the company has been a great place to work and I cannot complain about any aspect of my work at the moment.</p> review2355: Much smaller engineering team compared to the headquarter. The range of projects is narrow and most of the team meetings involve Hangout meetings with engineers in Mountain View.</p> review2356: dont ever work till now.</p> review2357: Simple work, not much exciting career opportunity, your experience varies based on the office/ position you take</p> review2358: Some lower level managers are not as good.</p> review2359: So many projects you can be involved in.</p> review2359: Everything is Goooooood with this company..</p> review2360: You have to work over time a lot, plus you have really extensive projects. Your life overall can decrease and will spend most time at work.</p> review2361: sometimes to much work to do</p> review2362: difficult to get out of the dream</p> review2363: - It&#039;s getting quite bureaucratic in some teams</p> review2364: not good for professional experience</p> review2365: - Most people are super smart, but many of them lack even basic social skills and they WILL drive you up the wall. - Google is a really good large company, but it is a large company. Creeping bureaucracy and attempts at making everything more corporate are a daily theme and, if left unchecked, will eventually destroy the culture. - People retention measured in decades has its downsides. Because Google has been so successful, the old-timers see little reason to adopt engineering practices of the 21st century, and Google is slowly but surely slipping further and further behind the industry in tools and programming practices. - GOD DAMNED OPEN OFFICE PLANS. The scourge of tech companies. Google is one of the worst offenders.</p> review2366: Definitely becoming much more big and &#034;corporate&#034; than it used to be.</p> review2367: nothing bed about this for it worker</p> review2368: HR is a pain to work with and even after two years the internal &#034;level system&#034; is still a black box to most people who work at the company. Recruiters are some of the worst as they lie and try to screw you out of compensation when you&#039;re initially hired. Even as a full-time Googler who interviews ~2/3 candidates a month, recruiters are still difficult to work with as they oftentimes don&#039;t understand the role you&#039;re trying to fill.</p> review2368: Entry-levels are uninteresting with little learning opportunities;</p> review2369: - know exactly what role you are changing. If you think you will be designing/marketing Google glass 2.0 or the driver-less car, think again</p> review2370: Sometimes slow to take decisions, convincing upper management on tech development can be challenging.</p> review2371: None ! Only Pros for any job you do here.</p> review2372: beauracracy in terms of filling all these forms and documents; plenty of meetings eat a lot of workday time</p> review2373: Easy to lose track of work life balance.</p> review2374: Sometimes too many people work on the same, small feature</p> review2375: The hours are long ...</p> review2376: Lower level leadership si weak, not working to develop business but more on creating redundant process, to stuck with their own metrics to moving things for the good.</p> review2377: lack of transferable skills</p> review2377: none i could think of</p> review2378: Low salaries, pay determined by bonus scheme</p> review2379: There&#039;s no downside, good company</p> review2380: boring job sometime, not very creative and bit traditional way of business handling</p> review2381: Sometimes it gets really competitive and since you have highly qualified and ambitious people all around you it can be a bit tough to stand out.</p> review2382: I felt that interns should be given projects with a little bit more direction. To be honest, as a second year computer science student, I did not know too much about Google&#039;s internal architectures, so expecting me to clarify my assignments was a tall order; I would have been able to contribute more with a little bit more direction.</p> review2383: Cut throat competition making it difficult to grow vertically</p> review2384: Too many changes at some point, lack of career discussions</p> review2385: no cons except it is very competitive and the hiring bar is very high but i am someone who loves a competitive environment since I believe it pushes you to do better! Maintain the awesome culture of thriving intelligence and efficiency</p> review2386: google getting bigger and bigger, and individuals having less and less sense of impact. Some people (esp. from consulting) believe google culture does not teach juniors in a structured manner</p> review2386: Teams are quite small, and sometimes you dont really work as a team due to he fact thta functions are divided</p> review2387: No cons as if till now. Sometime you will feel inferior in front of others</p> review2388: competition. Strong sales targets not focusing on clients.</p> review2389: Career growth and promotions are the biggest problem at Google.</p> review2390: The system is big and it is hard to change things. Also, you feel your impact small.</p> review2391: People find it hard to leave as the salary and other benefits are relatively better than elsewhere. There&#039;s also a highly competitive streak amongst some leaders.</p> review2392: Very political, very competitive Messy org, every team is doing their own thing, lots of redundancy. Lack of work life balance. Some managers pretend to be supportive, others dont even try to pretend</p> review2393: Very hard working conditions! Making us sort arrays all day!</p> review2394: Mountain View focused and difficult to get opportunities in SYD</p> review2395: Big corporate so you may not get proper attention</p> review2395: High pressure, lack of organization</p> review2396: No Cons I found yet.</p> review2397: Very difficult to move out of a sales role. Not alot of lateral movement under 3 year mark. Very political.</p> review2398: Free food keeps adding weight.</p> review2399: being attached to work and hard to have good work life balance</p> review2400: Google values are gone, this has become a giant money making machine which still attracts interesting people, but for how long? Bureaucracy and politics are growing strong like in any big corp, and much people think about their career first, innovation second (if at all). Hard to feel productive and useful.</p> review2401: - the review process seems to be quite slow to me and it takes time to submit code - intern don&#039;t have that many permission and usually there are many problems with that</p> review2402: Everyone is overqualified. Projects you work on are not suited with your experiences</p> review2403: not bold, not aggressive, not bold, not aggressive,</p> review2404: Very time consuming and demanding</p> review2404: Large company, less personal more team focussed</p> review2405: There are certain rules for developement and other things that have to be followed. Due to the size there is more corporate restrictive behaviour and due to the massive hiring the mindset of new hires does not always align to the company.</p> review2406: One of the biggest cons is the recruitment process. I didn&#039;t feel that I was being taken care of there. I didn&#039;t feel like some of the recruiters even cared who I was. There&#039;s also a big distinction in treatment between FTE&#039;s and contractors/temps/vendors.</p> review2407: Not exactly the best pay for the calibre of developers whom they employ, most of their employees could earn a higher salary elsewhere.</p> review2408: None that I can think of!</p> review2409: Nothing Nothing Nothing Nothing................ Nothing.....................Nothing</p> review2410: no cons as such. google is perfect.</p> review2411: Not much to learn unless you get promoted, management (Google staff that run the project) is a bit condescending at times, repetitive nature of the job, contracts are never renewed and getting hired is impossible, software is slow which is a problem when you are trying to hit a target</p> review2412: A bit slow on the product release and decision making!</p> review2413: - Big company = not as transparent as it used to be - Getting things done sometimes takes forever because of legal / privacy - Politics in middle management, as everywhere</p> review2413: As for cons, nothing comes to mind now!</p> review2414: nothing can be said in cons</p> review2415: Slow promotions cycle Large company Maturing Easy to get lost</p> review2416: - Poor promotion prospects at higher levels outside Mountain View</p> review2417: contract could not be extended</p> review2418: This mentality that Google is the place to &#034;end up.&#034; The sales floor is full of unmotivated, uninspiring, untalented people who are perfectly happy coasting by as they can never get fired. As a young grad who wants to learn and make an impact, it was disappointing. Also lots of people get ahead by &#034;playing the game&#034; and SO MUCH POLITICS. It was truly sad to see untalented (some even downright stupid) people get ahead.</p> review2419: nothing that I can think of right now</p> review2420: - The size of the company can be overwhelming for some people - The overall experience depends on how committed your host engineer is to you Can&#039;t really think of anything else.</p> review2421: Too much work, to less free time, too many clients, too many statistics, too many team events, too much woring time</p> review2422: They terminated my contract because of my pregnancy.</p> review2422: Middle management was variable in terms of effectiveness</p> review2423: None if you&#039;re willing to work hard.</p> review2424: work life balance life work balance</p> review2425: Should increase staffing within the organization.</p> review2426: Sub-standard boring manual work. Zero work satisfaction. Do not join Google India if you are being hired as a campaign manager or Strategist. The work in these roles is absolutely rubbish which would be suicidal to your career. Many people have fallen victim to the brand and money they offer only to end up doing manual mundane and boring work which a 10th Std passout can do.</p> review2427: Scrappy company Bad PR on occasion Advertising world based on experience, not skills, at times</p> review2428: It has become a huge company and if you are working in smaller offices and in non-product related teams, you feel almost dispensable. Sad but true.</p> review2429: Information overload can lead to distraction, ongoing struggle to scale.</p> review2430: It&#039;s not organized and at some points dishonesty and hierarchy can be noticed.</p> review2431: Work/Life balance may suffer at times.</p> review2431: everything revolves around Mountain View. hard to get career opportunities if you are working outside of mountain view. Promotions are a touchy subject.</p> review2432: Lack of parking spots and not so cheap</p> review2433: bureaucracy, hard to innovate,</p> review2434: no cons at all mate, not even a single con, literally not even a single one</p> review2435: Upward mobility for talented individuals can be a problem - some people enter the company at the wrong level and get stuck.</p> review2436: The only downside was that as a contractor, I had to leave when my contract expired without finishing the project.</p> review2437: Nothing much, every one know about it..</p> review2438: can&#039;t thing about real cons!</p> review2439: far away employees not well-known Translation Tools Need to be impoved Ranking too more pics</p> review2440: it is a numbers driven company anything that can&#039;t be measured has no place there. that sometimes makes it frustrating to plan and execute projects with an undetermineable outcome.</p> review2440: Google is becoming an adult - here&#039;s to hoping it never loser its inner creative child.</p> review2441: work-life balance (it is possible if you want to be stuck all the time on the same level, without any promotion, however, to get other opportunities within the company or to get finally some decent pay raise, you need the promo, which also your over-ambitious colleagues without any social life or family commitments go for, and thus a competition from hell unleashes of who can manage to sleep the least time possible) promotion very, very hard because of promotion quota a big mess with processes - they want you to excel at something that was launched a week ago and does not work properly yet at all, and your personal rating depends on that contradictory requests on every step of the way</p> review2442: small scope: Regardless of where you are coming from your scope will significantly shrink at Google and this is a result of a company that is gigantic.</p> review2443: There are actually no cons</p> review2444: Google is run as a business. When the interests of employees and the company diverge the outcome is not always deemed satisfactory by some. Sometimes this results in good people leaving the company despite them liking their existing role / location.</p> review2445: A lot of employees so creativity is not easily achieved</p> review2446: None in particular as witnessed in my personal opinion/tenure. Maybe a bit pay raise would be good in my opinion.</p> review2447: Job diversity, differing internal initiatives</p> review2448: They don&#039;t pay interns as much as one would expect compared to their standards. I&#039;ve got to fill in this stuff.</p> review2449: Large organization, high workload with picks, could tend to become not very personal given the large amount of employees worldwide</p> review2449: * Niche job roles (Non-transferable skill sets). No industry standard processes or tools are used. A proprietary tool for every need is already in place * Your fate in the organization is completely decided by 1 person - your immediate boss * Poor performance evaluation methods - Name sake panel and committee (No transparency)</p> review2450: Very big, a hole chain of manegmant</p> review2451: The requirements for entry positions are too high which results in people being overqualified for their jobs.</p> review2452: There are a lot of people who wants to work for Google. It can be very though to get a job in this company.</p> review2453: Nothing really , all is perfect</p> review2454: too much bureaucracy, politics, lack of career options, poor mid management</p> review2455: Bureaucracy steadily increasing, roles becoming increasingly specialized which limit the amount of possible growth for individuals.</p> review2456: Work/life balance. What balance? All those perks and benefits are an illusion. They keep you at work and they help you to be more productive. I&#039;ve never met anybody at Google who actually time off on weekends or on vacations. You may not hear management say, &#034;You have to work on weekends/vacations&#034; but, they set the culture by doing so - and it inevitably trickles down.</p> review2457: sometimes can get a bit much</p> review2458: Difficult workload, unsupportive management, along with technical equipment that malfunctioned and wasn&#039;t replaced as there wasn&#039;t any funds</p> review2458: for every company cons are normal.</p> review2459: Everything you do has to be under strict scrutiny of your superviser and has to gain his approval. Not much space for your self to call the shot and learn from failure. Bad motivation mechanism.</p> review2460: It is a big company. Probably the best one in history, but still a big company.</p> review2461: You can feel like a small cog in a huge wheel, and Google is known to hire overly qualified people for most tasks and positions</p> review2462: boring job, repetitive trends, not intersting</p> review2463: bureaucracy, politics, scale. Diminishing returns to role and content knowledge unless you can really push aside a lot of the operational/executional work and find the right project positioning</p> review2464: bureaucracy in different processes and sometimes the products which are launched have some faults</p> review2465: Very challenging and could be intimidating or difficult to handle</p> review2466: - Intense and sometimes stressful to work at</p> review2467: You&#039;ll find it difficult to move to other companies after getting these perks</p> review2467: less flexibility no work from home</p> review2468: Because there are so many talented people working at Google, it is possible that you will not get the kind of work you were initially looking for.</p> review2469: There were lots of conflicting projects</p> review2470: Like many other tech companies growing larger, Google is now a big corporation and from time to time it may seem more hierarchal than it should be.</p> review2471: - too much everything - never better anywhere after google (you feel disapoointed)</p> review2472: Slower growth makes new opportunities harder to find Lots of very senior, smart people you need to convince to let you try new stuff</p> review2473: Management hardly has people management skills, they don&#039;t treat their reportees as humans but as tools to reach their own goals. Very stressful environment, too much pressure, no work life balance.</p> review2474: working hours are some how unmanagable, easy to be overloaded</p> review2475: -Harder and harder to get promoted -(&#039;bottom heaviness&#039; will make many smart people seem normal performers) -Internal visibility is main focus of many employees (rather than business impact) -Same goes for many mid-managers (some very, some absolutely not, yet seems not to matter) -General &#039;positive&#039; attitude can be contagious &amp; expected - stifling questioning &amp; actual thinking -20% &#039;own project&#039; time more often and often dedicated by being a cod mid-manager projects (flavours of the month) - (more and more &#039;yes man&#039; behaviour) as trying &amp; failing might get you negative attention</p> review2476: still not enough money still to much work not enough benefits pay me more pls</p> review2476: I worked as a contractor at Google and the feel is very, very different. Firstly, you don&#039;t even get an official contract you get &#034;terms and conditions&#034; from the recruitment agency and they control EVERYTHING. Additionally, you also get a lot of conflicting information from the agency and Google. For example, the agency told me I cannot list Google on my LinkedIn profile and resume and Google told me I could, however, it must be in the form of XYZ - Contractor at Google ?!?!? I was told by my recruiter that the on site benefits were, &#034;go for your life&#034; there are actual specific doors that say &#034;NO CONTRACTORS BEYOND THIS POINT.&#034; After a month of being there I saw my role advertised Full Time on LinkedIn and all I did was ask my direct manager at Google about it and she got the agency recruiter to contact me telling me how, &#034;inappropriate&#034; it was when it was advertised to the public?!?!? Finally and most importantly as a  contractor at Google you are VERY, VERY disposable e.g; they can get rid of you for no reason with no warning with one hours notice and they even convisgated all my belongings.</p> review2477: Revenue is quite low as compared to the pressure</p> review2478: Bureaucracy creeping in Some parts particularly on Business side more top down Compensation less compared to other companies</p> review2479: So far i have not found anything to comment on.</p> review2480: The role itself is extremely repetitive. It&#039;s a factory process that Google are refining down to a fine art. Adwords, Adwords, Adwords. Maybe if I was in another department things would have been different but let&#039;s not forget where the majority of Googles roles are, Adwords is their cash cow. So that&#039;s business.</p> review2481: Not a lot I can think of</p> review2482: Be prepared for a bumpy ride with lots of opportunities.</p> review2483: Haven&#039;t found any yet fairly new to the company when I find something I&#039;m not happy with then I will come back and right some cons but haven&#039;t been with google long enough to make a comment</p> review2484: - Being a remote site has its disadvantages, which is reflected in late night meetings - Less option on the site. New projects get taken away. Hard to convince management for an idea. - Work life balance in hyderabad is not too great.</p> review2485: there are no cons</p> review2485: Work is difficult sometimes. Codebase will take time to understand.</p> review2486: There is no clear definition of how bonus is distributed Management were not very clear about policies. Salary hike was not done in appropriate way. Delay in giving answers for query asked.</p> review2487: No useful feedback from middle management Middle-management often of very limited cognitive abilities Targets are everything, feels very mechanic and absolutely repetitive</p> review2488: Google in my five years of experience became very big for me</p> review2489: There is lots of ambiguity. Even despite the fact that I love challenging situations and trying to figure out ways on my own, at Google you have to do almost everything by yourself.</p> review2490: - often poor product discipline outside of the cash cows sometimes leading to whimsical shut-downs - harder and harder to get promoted - more and more scrutiny on expenses</p> review2491: systems not built for client&#039;s greatest interest, unrealistic target, etc</p> review2492: It s hard to focus on a</p> review2493: Roller skates at work weren&#039;t necessarily encouraged.</p> review2494: Compensation is not the best while Google aspires to hire the best talent in the market. The hr team tries to reason but sitting outside country does not help</p> review2494: cant&#039; complain much about the place</p> review2495: 1. Bad management : managers change almost every 2 quarters 2. Politics</p> review2496: It´s becoming very big and slow</p> review2497: Got to be a big company now. Hierarchical org structure.</p> review2498: -middle management does only execution, no strategy at all</p> review2499: None at all. It&#039;s google</p> review2500: Middle Management here is horrible, petty, and not at the same level of many of the people they manage. If you get a manager that likes you you can get promoted and be granted an actual chance at transferring within the company- if not, well, good luck to you</p> review2501: i want to work from home because full time employment is not an option at home front.</p> review2502: highly competitive atmosphere sometimes creates stress</p> review2503: Management not invested in employee career development. Favoritism</p> review2503: Im happy to work them as a perfect worker</p> review2504: With time it becomes more like a large company with inertia and all the stuff that is associated with it.</p> review2505: shining yourself is very hard as surrounded by talents. 24/7 work would be necessary to be shined from others</p> review2506: for being such a big corporation with so many strenghts, sometimes career growth can be slow</p> review2507: Huge company, lots of politics.</p> review2508: Hierarchy and politics in sales, risk adverse local management, project vs impact focus</p> review2509: Too dependent on US so many evening video calls. As a large company, there are many teams and the quality of work and management varies between the teams.</p> review2510: nothing as such, just that they didn&#039;t ask us to chose team in my year, now they ask, so problem resolved.</p> review2511: No cons to working with Google. There is a valuable culture that all companies could learn from, not just internet companies.</p> review2512: too many staffs, the location</p> review2512: - Marching towards big corporate culture. - Very centralized, hard to show impact from a remote office. - Management is becoming deeper and deeper.</p> review2513: the benefit package is not very attractive</p> review2514: Pace can sometimes be frenetic</p> review2515: Getting more corporate and political, a lot more red tape. Getting better though, I feel. Tends to employ overqualified people, quite often have to work overtime although work/life balance is important for them.</p> review2516: The HR team needs to work on communication. There should be clarity in their talks. Not helpful for ex Googlers who want to join back.</p> review2517: Long hours, tight deadline. Interview process is ununnecessarily drawn out and painful, was rejected after interview twice before being called back a third time and offered position!</p> review2518: can become a bit too specialised</p> review2519: Their are no cons to specify in google</p> review2520: Some challenging work like more than enmities and I like my job</p> review2521: Tends to employ overqualified people, quite often have to work overtime although work/life balance is important for them. Lets you change jobs within company after a year but it&#039;s difficult to move up the ladder.</p> review2521: Usually important projects are concentrated in Mountain View.</p> review2522: Hard to get a full time position also if you are very good its a matter of headcounts</p> review2523: Many work hours dilettante management (especially Operation Leads) who is constantly demotivating employees - non-transparent system of promotion (better jobs are for &#039;&#039;very close friends&#039;&#039; of TeamLeaders/Operations Lead only)</p> review2524: No cons specificaly. Just one is that It&#039;s contact.</p> review2525: Work/life balance is not addressed, some &#034;hero culture&#034; is still damaging to teams.</p> review2526: I didn&#039;t find anything that I don&#039;t like except you have to work a lot.</p> review2527: Workload: With the culture of ambition and innovation comes high workloads. Complexity: Organisations and internal processes can be highly complex and difficult to navigate. Promotion: the organisation is still very flat and promotion is very competitive.</p> review2528: - No cons as such.</p> review2529: I don&#039;t have many cons about Google but software engineering i do. For one, deadlines they are very stressful to meet. secondly the amount of hours is huge.</p> review2530: Like most of the big companies it is very easy to get stuck in a job function and a role for a long time.</p> review2530: Difficult to have a good work/life balance, and have to be very willing to play internal political games in order to succeed at the company</p> review2531: Easily work 60+ hours/week Management is ruthless Expectations are unreasonable</p> review2532: messy process, some messy employees and experience</p> review2533: Highly political, leadership positions static</p> review2534: No matter how hard you work, if you&#039;re a contractor they give you the feeling.. And no matter how great you are, if you&#039;re applying for a permanent job within the company, for which a family member of Google employee is applying too, there&#039;s no chance for you. Been there.. Experienced it.. Totally nepotistic, yet will lie in your face, stutter and blush when you tell them you know why the other person was hired instead of you.</p> review2535: Tight Schedule transport food culture colleagues</p> review2536: - Actually ther&#039;s no downsides at working in Google</p> review2537: Getting too big, too slow to execute.. Very US centric limited opportunities in Europe with lots of re-orgs</p> review2538: Nothing much. Some teams arent as efficient as others.</p> review2539: lot of competition,lack of personal projects</p> review2539: Its very overwhelming at first, people have to prepare their self very good, so they can keep up the fast paced people in google.</p> review2540: complacency can creep in if you don&#039;t keep yourself updated.</p> review2541: Jobs can be mudane, ensure you enter at the right level. Google is like the care bears on the outside - the game of thrones on the inside.</p> review2542: With size comes a lot of bureacracy, and many things are too centralised in Mountain View</p> review2543: too many tasks per day</p> review2544: lack of work life balance</p> review2545: - Strong Performance Pressure with quarterly reviews, ratings that measure performance numerically and meticulously, and the need to over-perform for three consecutive quarters to even be considered for a promotion. Can lead to very slow career progression. - Lots of leg work and operations, often you manage chaos and company politics rather than make things happen - Lots of launches means a lot of overtime - Very ambitious and very competitive colleagues and shift culture towards having to put in a lot of extra hours and extra effort - Lack of diversity (everyone is an over-achiever coming from similar personal and professional backgrounds, both in business and on the engineering side)</p> review2546: gTech basically a help-desk, smart people doing menial jobs.</p> review2547: Excessive resources and created dependencies.</p> review2548: lots of pressure and too much politics</p> review2548: Very HQ-centric, hard to develop a career in a distributed office.</p> review2549: - By now very large; - Hence more bureaucratic; - Moves slowly.</p> review2550: Expected to work in a scrappy way and can be difficult to assimilate information at times</p> review2551: The grading system is very strange, my contribution during my internship did not count as much as after-internship interview results.</p> review2552: Bad management decisions and increasing bureaucracy.</p> review2553: sometimes you just dont know where to go to get things done interview process was extremely long and drawn out</p> review2554: Competitive environment No professional growth Hard to get promoted Senior management can be different throughout regions Silos sometimes</p> review2555: Too much work - not caused by top down pressure, just by the fact that everyone is super strong &amp; motivated to have an impact, so puts in a lot of hours</p> review2556: Very competitive and you compete with the best</p> review2557: market competition limited career growth opportunities</p> review2557: It will conquer the market in the next few years</p> review2558: Base pay is a little low, but that is due to the compensation package, such as free food (breakfast, lunch, dinner Monday through Friday), and many more perks.</p> review2559: very motivated, in the middle of the city</p> review2560: Job can get repetitive sometimes and the promotion is quite difficult to get as everybody is very ambitious.</p> review2561: As the company matures and acquires it&#039;s difficult to maintain a culture, new people from outside dilute the original work force</p> review2562: there is Nothing bad as such</p> review2563: extensive traveling causes a difficult work life balance</p> review2564: sensitive to your words of religion and culture</p> review2565: A lot of growth means a lot of growing pains. Lots of rough patches with employee dissatisfaction about one thing or another. A regression towards the mean, as you hire 50,000+ people, it will start to feel like a big company with big company problems.</p> review2566: No real downsides at working at this company, everyone is great and the culture is great. Not able to think of anything not great about the company.</p> review2566: work/life balance, large company. It&#039;s difficult to find where resources are sometimes. The company is so large it&#039;s hard to get a synoptic view and understand where you are.</p> review2567: as of now, long hours, complex technologies</p> review2568: Free Food, Amazing Culture, Work from home</p> review2569: Difficult to find a job there, somehow impossible, you may need someone works there to get in.</p> review2570: I really have no much cons while i worked in the organisation other than we need to struggle to make other employees understand our ideas. and the house keeping was horrible.</p> review2571: .... if you are in the wrong org, one that is not growing or has poor leadership or mid-management, get out fast! You are on a dead end track and nothing you can do will change that. The company has grown so large so quickly and you can really see it is wrestling with all the problems of adolescence, with bureaucracy and politics exploding in the years I was there. Performance management is broken and the best people do not always get the rewards they deserve. Adept upward management rather than doing the best job has become the surest way to rapid career advanceent. This is a real shame and needs to be nipped in the bud asap. It is not clear that the senior management are really aware of this or have the means or desire to get to grips with it.</p> review2572: everything is good here !</p> review2573: NA, Personal Growth, More openness</p> review2574: Change is always good for growth.</p> review2575: You need to be prepared to work hard - your bonus, standing, salary etc are all predicated on you working hard and continuing to improve. You need to show you are a team player as well as an individual, so be prepared to take on extra work to make the grade. It&#039;s a large company, so you have to find ways to stand out. Don&#039;t expect much of a home life at times - when you&#039;re up against it, it&#039;s expected you&#039;ll stay there all hours.</p> review2575: Extra competition, people are very smart and may use their brains to get ahead of you. Pay is too low for junior levels, impossible to live well with that salary in London.</p> review2576: Long hiring process. This can also cause issues further down the track. ie if a team is understaffed, filling the headcount can take quite some time</p> review2577: Can&#039;t think of any cons atm.</p> review2578: lots of work to do at all the time</p> review2579: - you have several people who can manage you and set your tasks - your manager, your team leader, engineering managers who you are collaborating with - too much bureaucracy - if you like problems to be solved immediately you should not start working at Google because sometimes it takes ages to get what you want - management overloads staff - it&#039;s hard to be promoted - you are assessed against other people in your team, even if you do 120% of your plan you are looser because there&#039;s always someone who does 121%</p> review2580: It may be more difficult to communicate with senior managers and other teams managers sometimes. I don&#039;t see a lot of cons in working in this company. If you&#039;re an entrepreneurs then maybe you won&#039;t be that attracted to it,</p> review2581: - Sometimes you may have to do projects that are not necessarily innovative or make the best use of your skills - Access to data that is needed for your job is hard to come by. It is always a constant struggle to convince the right folks to grant you access</p> review2582: Too much focus on some individuals</p> review2583: Red tape, aggressively competitive, giant corporation, lacks interest in individuals, no work life balance</p> review2584: Red Tape, Bureaucracy, Giant Corporation, meaningless perks, cut throat working environment, no work-life balance, no life outside Google</p> review2584: None that I would consider cons, if you are interested in progressing your career and enjoyed a fast paced working environment then I would encourage you to try Google</p> review2585: sometimes hard to tackle with maintenance/new stuff challenges</p> review2586: Not much to say about it</p> review2587: no cons here as it is very good</p> review2588: Not many -Some Good People -Avoid Cafeteria discussions</p> review2589: * Sometimes your job is just to shuffle data from one format to another * Sydney is an idiotically expensive city to live in. Despite the amazing compensation, I&#039;d be more wealthy working for some small dev shop in another city. * People in remote offices sometimes live in fear of that office closing. Sydney seems pretty safe, though. * Your workplace is endlessly discussed on the internet</p> review2590: - not all teams/dept/locations are treated the same - experience dependent on manager and their ability</p> review2591: Can be very demanding if you are not up to it.</p> review2592: zero growth and hence zero challenges. breeds mediocrity</p> review2593: Career opportunities and promotions are very tough. Company is build for growth not sure how things will change if growth stalls</p> review2593: Far from big officies where the most interesting things happening</p> review2594: has become too large &amp; bureaucratic now</p> review2595: Cult of growth. Everything is measured, quantified and evaluated in terms of growth and impact. Exponential growth is expected in every single metric: number of projects, number of users, lines of code, impact, whatever. If something stops growing, it usually gets killed. Do you remember Google Reader? It stopped growing. Look out for your own stats, and get transferred quickly if you stop growing at your current place. Lack of focus. Hyperactive and very disruptive development in most areas, with user experience neglected. It is starting to hit back (as of 2014-2015). Unfortunately, I can&#039;t go into details on the consequences of this one, due to confidentiality. Chaos. There is no stable point, everything changes all the time. All documentation is unfinished and/or outdated. Very few people have the &#039;big picture&#039; and they don&#039;t have time to share it, because they have to chase their own growth. Reorganization is continually happening. People c ome and go, teams come and go, products come and go. Usually we move 3-4 times a year. Noogler onboarding is often forgotten. There&#039;s a story about a noogler haunting the buildings for 2 months before finding out whom he reported to. I&#039;m not sure if that ever happened, but I&#039;ve seen people wandering around for several days. (Now I have the routine to spot them and help finding their team.) Long working hours and stress. This is most prevalent in SRE, but many development teams experience it, too. Cult vocabulary. There are hundreds of words for common things. On top of that, all projects have their internal codenames, and sometimes 3-4 different names refer to the same thing. You can speak whole sentences with words that only googlers understand. Willpower, Ikea, magnet, batman, etc.: those words do not mean what you think they mean. Location-specific issues. The company is centered around Mountain View, and you are almost certainly required to move there if y ou become important. Other sites (especially non-US sites) provide significantly less perks and choices. Mountain View is extremely crowded, and facilities can&#039;t keep up with the growth. Property prices are crazily inflated by googlers, and traffic is bad for the same reason. London still has some office space, but it pays much less than other sites, while living costs are the same or higher. The company sets the salaries based purely on industry average, not on living costs. The London benchmark seems to be flawed. You can&#039;t afford to rent any decent flat near the office, and commute is awful during peak times. Offices are open plan everywhere. Waiting for male toilets is very common at most sites. With regards to quality of life, the Zurich site is the most livable in Europe, and maybe New York in the US (until Eric Schmidt applies his stupid crowdedness-makes-you-creative theory).</p> review2596: Engineer driving company, other functions are relatively in the low area.</p> review2597: super demanding, competitive, highly political, many roles could be seen as &#039;cog in a wheel&#039; - hard to understand impact. work life balance.</p> review2598: Its a good place for to job. The company offer diferents position. But the distance between my home and the factory is far.</p> review2599: No Cons at all really</p> review2600: NA...the company is doing great</p> review2601: very big company strong competition internally</p> review2602: Compensation for sales roles can be low vs. industry and some client-facing jobs can be dumb (SMB sales or services).</p> review2602: big companies with the defaults it has</p> review2603: Not much. Some problems that big companies always have.</p> review2604: Much more challenging to be the outperformer if everyone around you is just as smart and competent. Highly competitive environment at times.</p> review2605: The company only operates in the domestic market ( Brazil ) , she was a multinational could provide me more knowledge and opportunities.</p> review2606: Long hours, difficult jobs and demanding management</p> review2607: Still small company Need more strategic planning visibility to all the company Marketing in a very early stage Dependence on Mobile Carrier but going to open internet</p> review2608: A big corporate, many projects are not that interesting, little or no research</p> review2609: I can&#039;t think of any.</p> review2610: time deadlines are tough leads to increased pressure on employees</p> review2611: Being pulled in a million different directions at once and being at the mercy of every-changing corporate initiatives. Also, after some time, the tidal wave of corporate reporting has a tendency to get in the way of actually getting your job done.</p> review2611: Not much but hiring bar is high and you need to keep performing</p> review2612: Low pay in India. The work-life balance is challenging if you are at the middle management level</p> review2613: No cons at all for this company</p> review2614: Getting too big and complex to manage, from 0 to 100 on locks and unthought procedures</p> review2615: - pay is lesser than the market for non-eng roles. -it is getting little hierarchial</p> review2616: there is nothing that goes against the google.</p> review2617: Not many... A bit too hierarchical</p> review2618: Limited to grow, few opportunities, low salaries and benefits</p> review2619: A lot of stress and responsibility</p> review2620: Mediocre senior managers, uncompetitive base salaries compared to companies with which Google competes for talent, extremely vague/frustrating promotion process compared to other companies,</p> review2620: It is no longer a start-up. You are one of many stars, all competing to outshine each other. Recognition is hard to obtain, unless you work on one of the very few shiny projects. It is very Calfornia-centric, with the commensurate decrease in life quality doing late evening meetings a lot. Stack ranking is a big demotivator.</p> review2621: Issues common to big companies; communication cost very high.</p> review2622: Too much legacy code, the internal codebase is unhealthy. Salary could be better.</p> review2623: Though it is one of the best places to work, management of some of the teams in India is not to the level of rest of the teams at Google. Some corporate politics happen in these teams. But even then, working in these teams is better than working in most other companies.</p> review2624: Hierarchical level of management. Managers can be a bit biased.</p> review2625: Nothing in particular. The experience was awesome. Sometimes collaboration with so many teams was challenging especially across time zones, but on the whole great experience</p> review2626: nepotism too many working hours you have to carry the weight of many genius slackers company doesn&#039;t really help to keep up with current techologies</p> review2627: Work culture is good with balanced work life</p> review2628: Nothing to be honest Really nothing at all Everything is great Nothing</p> review2629: The business org/subdivision that I worked for - had a lot of politics, hiring practices were not fair to employees, extremely smart people doing dumb things and getting paid at that low level too.</p> review2629: Need to explore other verticals in media capacity</p> review2630: Stack takes time to get used to.</p> review2631: I was bullied ut it was funny</p> review2632: nothing to tell all is perfect</p> review2633: maybe too many distractions,but it depends</p> review2634: - Poor people management with unclear performance review and promotion process. - Lots of reorgs with unclear communication and transition plans. - Internal mobility is unclear and hard.</p> review2635: The cons depend on one&#039;s style. Compared to the &#034;average&#034; reference in the market: - Very aggressive objetives and targets, sometimes unrealistic. - Frequent re-orgs (if you think this is a bad thing) - Usually long hours (if you demand a clear separation between &#034;work&#034; and &#034;personal&#034; life, this is not the place for you) - No career plan whatsoever (you own your career path and have to pursue your &#039;next thing&#039; yourself)</p> review2636: My role can be repetitive and targets can be disheartening. Promotions involve a lot of internal politics.</p> review2637: far from HQ, low salary, but not much cons overall.</p> review2638: Google has overqualified people for the role they are in. It fells huge and your impact is very small within Google.</p> review2638: Monotony after a while, ability to not grow beyond a level.</p> review2639: Could do with more perks</p> review2640: very good team work, smooth work and manage</p> review2641: Poor HR team which plays a big role in deciding your first posting and hence, in a way decides what you&#039;ll do initially at Google.</p> review2642: Very strict privacy and document sharing policy, that can be clearly explained by specifics of the business. Very little time remains to go home due to great facilities offered by Google.</p> review2643: I don&#039;t know really, i should be a little thing</p> review2644: Design of web page and special cabling of line</p> review2645: extreme competition can hinder the growth</p> review2646: big company, need to prove yourself to succeed, too much ownership so it&#039;s bad if you are used to being told what to do, how to do things rather than finding your way on your own.</p> review2647: No President&#039;s club - doesn&#039;t offer high incentives for over 100% achievement</p> review2647: Way too complicated systems, small impact on the whole project.</p> review2648: not much money and compensation</p> review2649: Very little hand holding provided There should be more structured bootcamp provided</p> review2650: - Intense work culture - Work hours can get long (but our mostly fun) - The company is much bigger now</p> review2651: Too few people and not borring XD</p> review2652: Google prides itself on a startup culture that has long since gone. It is extremely corporate in the American style, which can be tiresome. There&#039;s a very big visibility culture where being loud and &#039;present&#039; is very beneficial.</p> review2653: Every 8 months a reorg will happen and you will have to rush to find another role. Hr will be absolutely useless and will not help in any way. If you like not having a job every six months, then you are in for a threat.</p> review2654: Hard to develop your career further if you&#039;re hired into an entry level role, very difficult to move across job functions and ladders. Competitive and hard to get promoted.</p> review2655: no cons at all...Google is great!</p> review2656: Not enough on the job training. Also they don&#039;t give many flexible hours to work so you had to make 7am to 6pm regardless and you couldn&#039;t argue this point with them at all.</p> review2656: long hours poor mangement attitude slow carrer management</p> review2657: Being a largish company, individual contributions can get a little bit washed away. The criteria on which career advancement is based may be a little bit unfair for people who are not working on user facing or critical internal services. Internal communication and information is good but could be improved. The &#034;geeky&#034; and &#034;cool&#034; aspects of the company culture can be cheesy and annoying if you are not a kid.</p> review2658: Tasks could be very stressful sometimes</p> review2659: highly competitive environment , work life balance is a challenge</p> review2660: hard to feel like you make an impact</p> review2661: At present the company in business, work six days a week.</p> review2662: Compensation needs to be more aligned</p> review2663: large company , we may loose the sense of understanding what we want to achieve may not feel the ability to create impact. I used to call it the golden jail as many employees stayed there because it&#039;s comfy.</p> review2664: None that I can think of</p> review2665: Overqualified for the job Terrible mid managers</p> review2665: I think many of these cons are location specific, but for a remote office like India - Work-life balance goes down the drain - Most work is Mountain View centered, so offices with a big time zone difference feel cut-off, don&#039;t get the best projects. - Very speedy delivery expected. You can&#039;t move ahead if you can&#039;t work fast.</p> review2666: SMB is a joke, the managers don&#039;t even know how to use an excel spreadsheet or do a power point. Some of them might not even know the difference from CPA or CPM. Why they are managers? Simple as that, there are two heads that control everything and they promote people who praises them. One is ex photographer assistant who practices nepotism all the time and the other is a socialist. And why Google keep them there? Because you Dont need good people to do the work asked. Even monkeys could work in SMB Brazil. Google hiring bar has decreased a lot in the last few years, HR is doing a terrible job lately, skilled people Dont wanna work there. Why? Its not a good place to be anymore, the money is terrible and they try to sell you a glamour thing. Who lives on Glamour nowadays? Google Brazil and SMB are totally overrated. If you are a kid that wanna show off as the coolest hipster person in a fratty party, that&#039;s the place for you. If you aren&#039;t, its a tr ap.</p> review2667: a little too performance orientated, counter intuitive to trying to achieve great things.</p> review2668: start up on your own</p> review2669: it is geographically limited to italy</p> review2670: Mobility within department is hard. People usually struggle to survive but live their life somehow. so, not for all people.</p> review2671: - its getting to big - things are slower</p> review2672: Middle Management might not be the best and there is a virtual ceiling on the kind of jobs available in India</p> review2673: Nothing that I can think of.</p> review2674: Bureaucracy creeping in big corp incapable middle management</p> review2674: Job becomes repetitive at some point</p> review2675: In Brazil there is not so many growth opportunities, takes a long time to get promoted.</p> review2676: The working in google is a big big challenge. Every day is smth new and challenging.</p> review2677: It can be hard to fit in such a chaos organization. Also it sometimes leads to duplicates in the projects that people are working on.</p> review2678: Not a great place for business students</p> review2679: work pressure,good place to work , career growth , good people</p> review2680: * Loosing focus over the years * Lots of politics creeping in</p> review2681: no training, gotta grow the channel yourself.</p> review2682: You have to learn a lot, fast paced and need to be 100% committed all the time</p> review2683: - Salary isnt upto the market stds. - It has now become a very big company, hence there are chances you might get lost.</p> review2683: I didn&#039;t find any cons personally.</p> review2684: Didn&#039;t feel driven Cross functional opportunities</p> review2685: Growth in finance is tough...company is getting top heavy</p> review2686: I would say the main downside is that people work such long hours. Perhaps this is because the environment is so competitive. I also don&#039;t think the salary in London is competitive with the main alternative employers - investment banks.</p> review2687: - bad mid management - even worse team-leads. Either they are super good or super bad. - trainings are all internal and with G-products, so conveying certain skills to other non-Google related are difficult</p> review2688: Really crapy managers, all is management by numbers and win win philosophy is not applicable here.</p> review2689: Becoming bigger and more unwieldy and the layer of consultant management just below or at executive level and reducing the scope for innovation</p> review2690: sometimes you have to deal with difficult stuff</p> review2691: Bad managers can ruin your experience (as it&#039;s the case everywhere). People management initial layer is often chosen by wrong reasons. Thus these folks can&#039;t effective lead, and teams end up avoiding taking risks and innovating.</p> review2692: You tend to get complacent with all the luxury around you. Most roles have skills which are not transferable.</p> review2692: Management sucks. Lots of medicore managers waiting to get their stock options. Lack of direction. Lots office politics. Salary is average</p> review2693: Sine the environment is so fast paced and everyone there are so talented that people there with low skills feel little backward and sometimes do not show up properly.</p> review2694: Your growth in the company directly depends on the efforts you put in and results you produce. So always need to be on your toes and continue to work towards challenging goals.</p> review2695: - Sometime there is the &#034;big company syndrome&#034; that everyone is trying to overcome at Google</p> review2696: Very different from the early start up or even mid sized company days (understandably). Corporate, crowded- there is constant pressure and competition to stand out from the crowd. All employees are intelligent and motivated and striving to impress so it&#039;s easy to become a &#039;mediocre performer&#039; if you aren&#039;t constantly upping your game. Can be challenging if you have significant responsibilities outside work but is the best place to work if you are young, energetic and relatively &#039;free&#039; to dedicate most of your life to it.</p> review2697: The company towards the last part of my tenure has been way too political for my taste. The other issue is that the company was sometimes too slow to react to certain threats (eg social) which was disappointing</p> review2698: Lots of people with great potential, all looking for promotion. You might not get the opportinities to grow as soon as you think you deserve them</p> review2699: Job Description and Actual Work can be diametrically opposite :) Significant number of Googlers are kind of pretentious. Google hires over-qualified candidates. ( because they can :P ) Moving out of a role / office is very difficult. (You need to excel in your current role i.e. atleast get promoted once) Primary an Engg company. Anyone other than Engg. is an expendable resource.</p> review2700: long hours, pay is okay and could be higher</p> review2701: Too much competition Lack of variety in terms of work Started to act like a big organization</p> review2701: As a contractor you&#039;re completely ignored</p> review2702: Everyone is amazing, so it&#039;s difficult to stand out, can be competitive</p> review2703: Quality of more recent hires not as good as it used to be</p> review2704: lack of transferable skills. Many tools and technologies are Google-only, and I feel that my skills from the real world have atrophied significantly.</p> review2705: You are in a competitive environment and suddenly you&#039;re not one of the smartest of your peers anymore (like you were in college) but are really challenged to go above and beyond to stand out. And some teams are really competitive, especially those who get performance bonus. There is a LOT to learn and it is quite overwhelming and seems a little fuzzy in the beginning, but pretty soon there is this point where the puzzle suddenly starts to make sense!</p> review2706: Highly specialised for each job role, there isn&#039;t much you can do outside your job description Low mobility, caused by said high specialisation, if you want to slightly change the type of area you work on, it&#039;s going to take you maybe years</p> review2707: There is no much use of open source.</p> review2708: Google is struggling with big company problems. Lots of layers slow things down and can disenfranchise one a bit.</p> review2709: no cons as such good place</p> review2710: Difficult to get into the company... Promotion will take a lot of hard work, more than what is required in other average companies...</p> review2710: Work life balance Work life balance</p> review2711: I joined this role thinking that the job can lead me to Engineer position. The managers in this position are not really smart. They cannot understand your career plan. - They just make you feel worthless - Will be stuck in the position unless you impress your current manager - One will learn nothing in these type of positions. - This position is for people who just want to relax and not bothered about what they are learning.</p> review2712: Very rigid recruitment process which makes it difficult to manage candidates. Expectations are super high so expect long hours and to be overloaded. Most recruiters do not get extended after the 11 month contract.</p> review2713: -Horrible managment -repeating work -long hours -stupid rules</p> review2714: Night calls all the time</p> review2715: Moving up is hard, sometimes politics play a role in promotions etc... Moving to another office as not as easy as they make it seem.</p> review2716: too big and corporate these days</p> review2717: have not come across cons yet !</p> review2718: Always changing, fast paced, performance focused environment. Might prove testing for people who don&#039;t manage their work/life balance well.</p> review2719: -Over the past few years became a huge corporation, slowing down promotions and internal movements, reducing time for extracurricular projects and skyrocketing targets. -Average management is often very average -New hires with extensive experience in the field are often too overqualified for the basic work they are doing in sales or support</p> review2719: For people outside the US, increasingly becoming too US (well Valley) centric - aside from regional roles most of the interesting senior roles are based there, beware if you are in Europe or elsewhere globally. Drain of people moving there as the only means to further their careers. Also politics (as with any big company) is rife and silo&#039;s strong. Finally don&#039;t expect to have much of a life outside of the company</p> review2720: - Middle management - Too large</p> review2721: Salaries are not that satisfying, getting promotion does not only depend on how well you do your job but you need some show off to be visible at management level.</p> review2722: -Job profile is not challenging especially for people looking to work up the ladder. -The work tends to get monotonous and after a period of time &#039;burnout&#039; becomes inevitable.</p> review2723: Working with lots of experienced professionals is a challenge itself. Be sure to be ready to work with competitive(in good way) people that challenge the status quo.</p> review2724: It is not as relax as other&#039;s like Oracle, but I think for early new grad, it totally worth it to work hard and learn the experience.</p> review2725: At times can be overhead working on a large code base. Need to ensure your changes do not break anything.</p> review2726: dificult to do the job Some diferent of my others jobs Low Cost of region is espensive Personal growth</p> review2727: payroll was not satisfactory need to improve it</p> review2728: Sometimes working with people that pretend to be all geniuses has its drawbavks</p> review2728: Very High expectations. But they vary from the roles you take up.</p> review2729: Internal mobility is quite hard. Sometimes, even good people struggle to survive in the company due to very high expectations. Here, you are either continuously moving forward or you get out of the way - you cannot remain at the same level of performance for a long time.</p> review2730: No cons can be found</p> review2731: Job is not satisfying, but that is the same in all other companies. There are little possibilites to grow in the company, at least before a two year tenure</p> review2732: Te actual day to day job is not rocket science. It gets very operational and it will probably not be your calling in life.</p> review2733: I can&#039;t imagine working somewhere else even for much more money.</p> review2734: I don&#039;t see there are any obvious drawbacks. This company has a good work/life balance and provides learning opportunities internally. Maybe a pity is that time is too short to consume what the company provides you with every day.</p> review2735: Bad Chairs , bad place for growth and i think people may get more depress after going to posh.</p> review2736: Middle management from Very good to Very Bad Way too political Core Job very boring below L5 Salary lower than many places in the Industry HR Department in Dublin purely clueless Good for entry level work</p> review2737: perks are low, but consistent</p> review2737: I found some of the most hypocrite and unauthentic people I ever met in my life. Very manipulative environment.</p> review2738: always need to be innovative</p> review2739: Commute sucks if you are in SF Compensation not competitive if you are outside of MTV Internal transfer is way too hard Difficult to navigate career path Internal politic can get a bit much Performance management are difficult for people outside of SWE ladder</p> review2740: In cases, the person is overqualified for the job. Google has enough influence and attractiveness to bring on people that are too qualified for their jobs. Google rightly prides itself in having an amazing workforce, but it sometimes comes at the underutilization of people&#039;s abilities.</p> review2741: It never feels like you&#039;re doing work worth doing, Google always hires smarter people than necessary to get work done and they know that they&#039;re Google and hence pay less than what you will get at other companies.</p> review2742: Pay Zero process Crappy interview process Cowboy projects Repetitive projects</p> review2743: mechanic work, no challenges, no transparency</p> review2744: Never a dull moment!</p> review2745: It&#039;s easy to lose track of what time it is. Make a point to leave earlier than you&#039;d want, it&#039;ll help you in the long run.</p> review2746: Google is a large multinational company with all the bureaucracy and inertia that implies. If you get a decent manager and an interesting job it&#039;s alright. If you get a bad manager that could make your life very hard.</p> review2746: nothing as far i have seen.</p> review2747: Targets way too high, stressful, account management in local countries not on line with inside sales (juniors) which creates a mess in communication</p> review2748: Salary not too attractive. That said, benefits are great</p> review2749: The company puts you in a comfort zone and makes it difficult to get out of it.</p> review2750: - Highly competitive - So big now that progress is hard no matter how good you are - Innovation from the ground up can be hard - Performance management curves</p> review2751: Interesting projects are hard to come by outside the US hub. There is a hierarchy even if they claim there isn&#039;t. Decisions take forever - everyone&#039;s opinion is valid, yet there are too many decision makers and no decisions. Promotion is more about who you know that what you did. You will work long hours - usually till 7pm.</p> review2752: very competitive - Salaries are not as competitive as other competitors</p> review2753: Smart people everywhere. Getting overcrowded. Perks, kitchens are worse than in other Googles. Office essentially segregates the engineers from the non-engineers (different floors), gives it a weird feeling. Harder to get promoted higher than senior in a non-MTV office.</p> review2754: too big to make an impact, little scope for promotion and growth, the work is not that great for a newbie</p> review2755: Nothing as such , Unless until you dont work .</p> review2755: Nothing as such as we see here.</p> review2756: It&#039;s hard to move up the ladder.</p> review2757: The Sydney office has become increasingly corporate and there&#039;s plenty of office politics. It&#039;s great place for someone who is early in their career, however unless you love media sales it&#039;s a challenge to find the right role for those who are more advanced in their career.</p> review2758: Promotions, career opportunities may take a while, but worth it.</p> review2759: Organization is big and lots of organization</p> review2760: Contractors are not being treated well in the outsourced places (Google maps Dublin). That&#039;s probably the agencies fault, but still, I left after 6 months because of it.</p> review2761: immature environment, sometimes lack of professionalism. kids in diapers that thing they know it all.</p> review2762: High competition for the same job</p> review2763: Internal mobility can be hard but the options out there are fantastic. Much will hinge on how well Google handles growing pains in the coming few years.</p> review2764: Peer pressure. You need to prove yourself all the time.</p> review2764: Boring work is done in it</p> review2765: Work life balance could be surely improved.</p> review2766: The buildings that they are located in have funny furniture. too cool for school</p> review2767: just 23 months contract not extendable.</p> review2768: Difficult to stand out in an environment of over-achievers</p> review2769: Work/life balance simply does not exist at all. I believe the company cares and wants to fix this, but they have so far failed. Working in an open-plan office can be hard and stressful.</p> review2770: It is better than being at home. Sometimes I&#039;d consider it too good.</p> review2771: For folks for whom this company is the first job, there&#039;s very little genuine understanding of the value that this company provides. Everyone focuses on the perks but it takes them a while to understand the ethos / culture truly. No matter what the review say, at the end of the day to succeed one has to work smartly and put in their 110% to see results.</p> review2772: Working with Google Maps ,is not atall a gud fetching oppurtunity when to want to change your job.</p> review2773: Growth is extremely fast and we are beginning to see large-company issues and difficulty in moving roles internally due to changed expectations of experience which long time employees are often not exposed to. Also, poor performers are not dealt with correctly. There&#039;s a lot of leniency and sometimes, this can affect the entire team.</p> review2773: Poor management, lack of experienced people managing less inexperienced people. To move forward you have to play a game and pretend you are a hippie &#034;googley&#034; person, what can be very annoying. Politics based on a non corporative environment. Meaning: you cannot move forward if you dont drink, attend to social events, play games and pretend you are like every one else there &#034;superior hipsters&#034; and the &#034;most educated people in the whole world&#034; which is not true. Base salary is below the market as they try to sell you that &#034;money is not important&#034;, you will end up doing very low impact roles within the company, but will say its OK because &#034;Its Google&#034; and &#034;you&#039;ve finally made&#034;.</p> review2774: Not many that I can think of so far ......</p> review2775: fast work &amp; big man its my dreams</p> review2776: Have to balance both college and events equally. Creating a proper impact .targeting correct set of audience.</p> review2777: The company is a bit overwhelming</p> review2778: Management is generally appalling, I literally have never encountered people with less ability to lead and motivate people and just understand the basic dynamics of people. Contractors are treated as second class citizens. Even though they are participating highly both in terms of operations and projects. Managers make false underhanded promises about being kept on to many contractors in the hope that this will motivate people to work even harder. But people talk and such strategies become transparent. It is embarrassing spending so much money on parties/off-sites etc. while the contractors slave away and then are told there is no budget to keep them on. (Many of them are far more intelligent than the FTEs and working much harder, and it feels like they know that and are just using them for as much as they can) Googlers have a tendency to become entitled and egotistical. Yes, the physical workplace is great, but it is too much of a bubble and actually the environm ent is stressful and not really all that friendly. Even the Kitchen staff seem miserable. The expectation of excellence is fraught in the air, which often results in an underhanded competitiveness between team members and long, long working hours. Ya those pool tables are nice, but I never really had time to play them. Googlers are too mono, there is no diversity in thought, age, race etc. Which is a huge criticism really when you think of the values they hide behind and the people they should be considering. If you strip away the benefits and the incredible value of having Google on your CV, this would have been one of the worst employment experiences in my life. I think the difficulty is getting to grips with the frustration of how they are perceived, and how they actually operate. Many of the FTEs have worked nowhere but Google and think they are uber fantastic for having landed a job there and what they are doing is the most important thing in the world but there lack of  life experience shows massively in how they handle their work and many of them feel like they are part of a cult.</p> review2779: Chaotic environment, not for the faint of heart.</p> review2780: Childish culture Low pay Lack of opportunity to move up</p> review2781: Had to try hard for Onsite....</p> review2782: long work hours &amp; constant goals</p> review2782: After a while, you get too much pigeon-holed in to a specific role; Only x% of the people still do get to work on awesome open source stuff - everyone else works on a gaint, pretty much closed ecosystem, platform and tech stack wise. Also, the company is getting too big, a little outside of everyone&#039;s comfort zone; almost 0% work-life balance;</p> review2783: Progression can be arbitrary.</p> review2784: No room for career development, many people work on weekends in order to manage the workload</p> review2785: Not a lot of interesting project outside (and even in) Moutain View</p> review2786: you will become really fat &amp; lazy</p> review2787: Middle management is full with people who were recruited very early and not up to current Google standards.</p> review2788: nothing as of now. lets see in the future.</p> review2789: A bit of annoying arguments between the employees of different vendors. But healthy comversations</p> review2790: sometime the work life balance is hard to maintain</p> review2791: Some of the senior management could be non googley</p> review2791: Bureaucratic, at times not transparent enough.</p> review2792: work-life balance, too much work, not limited</p> review2793: very hard to get noticed or promoted</p> review2794: Not everybody is smart enough</p> review2795: Salaries are relatively low, though I would say that the benefits more than make up for it. Not sure how many opportunities for promotion there are.</p> review2796: Too few teams in remote locations</p> review2797: Almost no place for growth within the same role, and you become overqualified for the role fairly quickly</p> review2798: Expectations are very high and people can be very competitive depending on your field. It can be stressful. In addition, it seems most people work round the clock and I found myself on email nights/weekends, not because I had to be, but I felt that it was the norm. It can take over your life a bit.</p> review2799: The benefits entitlement can be chaffing. How many times I have heard people complain about the lines to get free stuff or the lack of &#034;offsites&#034; (fun days when you get paid but don&#039;t do any work) in the past 3 months. Internal politics can be difficult as some are incredibly good operators and some are allergic to politics and pander, so it often feels like an uneven playing feel. In engineering particularly, there are as many allergic managers so the effect is less, but in other functions, you often have to fight your corner.</p> review2800: Work pressure is high, especially during project deadlines. Very few opportunities for recreation like games.</p> review2800: For working in Google the main criteria is that you need to have good communication skills to interact with business delegates. When we handle our responsibilities and total effort then we are also been rewarded with incentives.You find a growing career in the organisation.</p> review2801: no any cons, i like it</p> review2802: Sales in some specific markets became harder and harder.</p> review2803: - the size of the company and the ability to make an impact - junior managers with very little experience</p> review2804: Company business is not complicated enough to give challenging work to most of the employees.</p> review2805: Slowly growing into a massive, more bureaucratic company</p> review2806: If you are not a self-starter, you may get complacent easily, and stop the learning process completely. Only the people who are very motivated can make the best use of Google culture.</p> review2807: It&#039;s hard to have a life separate from work — the entire ecosystem is designed to make it more comfortable and compelling than home! Everyone I know who left tries to reinvent various versions of the internal tech they have.</p> review2808: For working in Google the main criteria is that you need to have good communication skills to interact with business delegates. When we handle our responsibilities and total effort then we are also been rewarded with incentives.You find a growing career in the organisation.</p> review2809: it is too big for one to make a difference</p> review2809: Political decisions based on visibility</p> review2810: Process Management can be improved better</p> review2811: The problem is that it became a litle bit boring after a couple of years.</p> review2812: Can&#039;t think of working else where :(</p> review2813: not much, except it&#039;s competitive</p> review2814: No great cons - Large company now</p> review2815: Lack of transparency...sometimes I was shocked how little people knew about other departments / products / worklfows, considering how essential it is to be aware of the bigger picture.</p> review2816: High growth challenges as the fast agile historic environment tries to deal with a growing workforce. Internal systems need attention and investment.</p> review2817: Base salary not competitive. It seems like a large chunk of that is funneled into providing the great perks.</p> review2818: You get to work with the best and smartest people in the world who can always find a fault with anything and everything.</p> review2818: Getting bureaucratic but that is to be expected due to the size of the company</p> review2819: - It feels like a big company, with all disadvantages of that. - A small remote office does not have as much flexibility or options as the headquarters. - 20% projects? They are most likely 100% + 20%. - Infrastructure sometimes slow you down (infrastructure is the cause and the solution of all engineering problems).</p> review2820: As with all large corporations, there&#039;s a growing layer of middle management. This means bureaucracy, politics and the need to promote the so called &#034;personal brand&#034;. Some managers need more education on how to motivate people. Proposals may go through a lengthy approval process. Recruitment is rather slow as I remember it.</p> review2821: Nothing major comes to mind.</p> review2822: Low salary (Latam), curve evaluation for promotion, Long hours. BA program (a sort of young professionals program) makes you unable to transfer for 2 years.</p> review2823: work gets mundane after a point of time.</p> review2824: One of the Google&#039;s uniqueness is &#034;flat&#034; organization. However, by growing the company and having more people, organization became kind of bureaucratic and have more hierarchies.</p> review2825: Nothing as such as the brand name is too good</p> review2826: - Very long hours 9-10 hour days not uncommon. (very short break). This is partly due to the fact that many languages are understaffed and overworked. Google is making billions but somehow justifies that hiring more people is too costly and difficult. - Stressful work, with loads of bureaucracy and processes that needs to be followed. - People tend to work weekends as well. On my team people often work while on vacation. - No clear career path, most people leave the Dublin office, after 2 years because they either burn-out or can&#039;t progress anywhere in the organization. - Too much middle-management.</p> review2827: You can get addicted to work. You might gain weight because of all the food. You might get used to a great environment and spoiled for life.</p> review2827: well, it&#039;s very hard to move up the ladder there as there are so many talented people and not enough leadership roles to move into. However, you can do parallel (horizontal moves if warranted).</p> review2828: None. There are no cons. Google is the best employer in the world. Can&#039;t get any better. Google is the dream employer.</p> review2829: Not a typical corporate set up so you will face trouble dealing with work culture at other places if you ever decide to move out. This also leads to stagnation at some point in cases where direction is a little unclear</p> review2830: good enough to work in</p> review2831: Google cannot have anything less than the best</p> review2832: No job satisfaction. Any one would maximum work for 1 year</p> review2833: Not invented here for pretty much all technology.</p> review2834: As Google has grown out of being a startup in the last 5 years, the bureaucracy followed. It gets harder and harder to just Get Things Done, since now there are endless reviews and committees that need to sign off. Promotions are less data-driven and more horse-trading, since there are caps on numbers and justification ends up needing alliances between managers. Salary is below market, the justification being that all the (mostly intangible) benefits make up for the shortfall, and increases have been barely inflation-beating over the past few years (I&#039;m not a low performer). Your job progression is rather limited, since you won&#039;t make a lot of impact unless you are the rockstar amongst all the rest of the 1%, and you definitely need to have a lot of ambition to fight to move upwards.</p> review2835: - hard to be promoted - work-life balance</p> review2836: One drawback is there are no inventory level guarantees. This is true of any network, but with Google it can get even more difficult as you can&#039;t reserve inventory (expensive home page buyouts aside). A bidder can bump you out of certain placements by bidding higher and raising his maximum CPM.</p> review2836: - Overqualified people for almost every position - Difficult to keep separation between work and life.</p> review2837: - long hours in sales</p> review2838: no as such cons i discovered yet in my experience</p> review2839: None.The brand name hides if are any.</p> review2840: Nothing as such, Google has the best working culture</p> review2841: nothing to say about it yaar</p> review2842: It&#039;s now quite a bit company and with that comes more structure and less of an entrepreneurial feel.</p> review2843: Middle Management below expectations Core job quite boring Constant brainwashing</p> review2844: There isn&#039;t anything that has been bothering me.</p> review2845: There were very few women in senior management. Lack of mentoring for those in more junior roles.</p> review2845: Increasing bureaucracy, work/life balance is bad</p> review2846: Micromanagement by some new Managers. Otherwise none!</p> review2847: Long days, working for global company means multiple timezone meeting times.</p> review2848: Working on Contract Based whi</p> review2849: Falling into the pattern of any other large company</p> review2850: stuck-up people, think they are the best and brightest but they are just ivy league students with no idea about the real world</p> review2851: Google is growing as a company so it&#039;s loosing that start up, you can do anything feel. It&#039;s becoming more and more corporate and bureaucratic.</p> review2852: nothing that i can think of</p> review2853: Not as agile as before in terms of decision making and getting through with your ideas</p> review2854: Located in Dublin, race for promotions is detrimental for performance especially at more junior levels.</p> review2854: Focus on academics means lack of proper direction It&#039;s all changing</p> review2855: Google&#039;s logo is &#034;Don&#039;t be evil&#034;. Well, Google separates workers in at least 2 social classes, not to say 3 or 4. Proper &#039;Googlers&#039;or full time employees are Class 1. They have great perks, great Christmas presents -Chromebook/Nexus 4/5/7-, incredible Christmas and summer parties, some of them go to Las Vegas for &#039;work&#039; purposes, some do trips payed by Google for team building, they can play ping pong and pool as much as they want with no pressure as long as they get things done. Class 2 are temps, conctractors and vendors. Most of them, after 11 months they are done, without a single autogenerated mail of &#039;good-bye, leave your badge at reception&#039;, and having to wait 3 months if they want to apply for another temp position. Their schedule is as rigid as the most rigid of companies: no breaks, no ping-pong, count your minutes if you go to the toilet. Of course, it depends too on how lucky or unlucky you are with the  manager that you have, sometimes Googlers, sometimes Temps as well (which is much worse than having a &#039;proper&#039; Googler). Temps see how their cooler Google peers get their wonderful presents and go to cool Xmas parties where they are not allowed to go. Temps have a badge of different colour that shows they are not Googlers. Temps don&#039;t have access to certain HR information where, for example, there are job openings that they could apply to become proper Googlers. (Class 3) Class 3 is a subclass of 2. Some of them come for a temporary period from East Point. They are temps, but even worse: they see how even fellow temps go every day to enjoy their lunch for free while they have to go to Eurospar to buy it or bring their lunch box from home. They can&#039;t use the gym, they can&#039;t use the swimming pool. No need to say they don&#039;t go to Las Vegas nor get Nexus for free o Hollywood-like Christmas parties. There are more sublclasses, but these are the main  ones. There&#039;s a lot of snobbery in Google, at least in Google Dublin. And there are less bright people and geniouses than people may think. Google Dublin is mainly a sales hub. So rather than talent, which of course there is, there are a lot of people from very expensive Business Schools that a good pocket can afford, but not a good brain.</p> review2856: None that I can think of</p> review2857: Too big an organisation so no room to be creative - you have to follow a set defined process and only have room to move within defined guidelines.</p> review2858: very fast paced, becoming more corporate (bureaucratic)</p> review2859: Not as much impact at an individual level as one would like</p> review2860: no negative points about the company</p> review2861: Useless management , too many policies changes</p> review2862: Seeing a down turn...over innovative</p> review2863: Despite the work culture, Google still is a corporation and does act like one of them in pactice. Meaning that when it comes to, e.g., internal re-Orgs or cuts on people, they don&#039;t consider the actual impact on employees, who, like myself, can be shifted from the role they were hired for to another role they would have never considered. During the reorg back in 2012 I didn&#039;t have any chance but to accept a new role which I never felt motivated for. Also, because of the huge competition, gaining visibility was more important than actual quality of work, in order to pursue career development.</p> review2863: Definitely not a startup anymore and you can start to feel the bureaucracy creeping in. Also, opportunities to really move up quickly are tougher to come by.</p> review2864: - Everything changes at a crazy pace (if your fine with that you will enjoy it)</p> review2865: Too many smart people around to push you to your boundary.</p> review2866: career progression is hard because no one leaves, most people are over qualified for their role. There is also a certain amount of intellectual arrogance</p> review2867: You always want to grow old with the same company</p> review2868: you need to be active to do things</p> review2869: 1, For this position, there is no (or very little) time to really enjoy the perks, and also very little flexibility with time/place (meaning, you have to be logged to your phone exactly on time, can&#039;t be a minute late even, and you can&#039;t work away from your desk). 2. Working extra hours becomes a must if you wish to just stay on your targets, and if you want to exceed them and get promoted - you either have to wait a long time (there is a queue..) or work even harder, or cheat (usually its a combination of all 3). 3. As the way that performance is being measured is far from being accurate, people do anything to get ahead, and that includes &#034;playing&#034; with the numbers to serve their needs. A Shame that this hasn&#039;t changed in the recent years and seems like it wont change in the future. 4. As targets and revenue goals are getting higher and harder - its easy to forget that there are actual people behind those numbers. But this is a hard task  for Google, at least in this role. 5. sometimes the role changes as time goes by, and if that change is not something you like or enjoy doing, if you wont adopt - it will affect your career/promotion (meaning, you are forced to do things you did not sign up for initially, and then being criticized for not doing well at them). All those things contribute to the demoralization of employees, and Google does that very well.</p> review2870: Opaque performance appraisal and wrongly skilled people-roles</p> review2871: Increasing hierarchy and structure limit freedom.</p> review2872: Everyone here is smart and talented!</p> review2872: Stressful: everything is about metrics, how much you do, how well you do it. You are compared to your teammates when it comes to performance review and you are told if you performed better than your team, average or below the rest of your team. The core job is repetitive and if you want to work on other roles you mostly have to do it extra hours, the teams are often stretched and you&#039;ll be on the phone 6-7 hours a day.</p> review2873: If you&#039;re not in Mountain View, career progression can be limited.</p> review2874: A LOT OF WORK AND PRESSURE</p> review2875: org hierarchy goes through a lot re-structuring. promotions can be very political.</p> review2876: In certain areas, Google is getting slower and slower, political, process-heavy and quite hierarchical. Nothing compared to most companies, but not as fast as you&#039;d wish. As a result, career progression can be slow.</p> review2877: People management can be pretty brutal, especially in the way performance is managed. It leaves too much space for favouritism and can be hugely demoralising.</p> review2878: There are pretty much no cons.</p> review2879: For the UK, it is only possible to work in London and while that makes sense for the business, I wouldn&#039;t be able to work for them again now I have moved away :-(</p> review2880: haven&#039;t came across yet... :)</p> review2881: They could work on getting some meaningful roles to India.</p> review2881: Big organization that is trying hard to stay innovative and flat. More bureaucracy is creeping in. Now that the company is bigger it seems like Google isn&#039;t bringing in the same calibre talent it once did and talented people are jumping into leadership roles in other companies.</p> review2882: its too difficult to get in and easy to get out cos there are poeple applying for your position when you still on seat</p> review2883: no cons till now in this org</p> review2884: I found a little bit yuppy , some of the staff are very blue chipped and the inside is not what is portrayed to the public</p> review2885: schedule, timings, info, communication, salary</p> review2886: Very difficult hiring process highly competitive work environment</p> review2887: Sometimes, you may have a bad manager</p> review2888: I work at YouTube. It is run like an army camp. Instructions come from top management which have not been well thought through but need to be obeyed, the caliber of some folks in senior management (esp. in functional support teams) is mediocre, protectionism (some folks incl. seniors still there and move ahead because they are protected by their seniors), 360 degree feedback is non existent i.e. promotions are at the whims and fancies of what 1 person perceives/thinks i.e. manager (no collective inputs taken from different stakeholders), territorial wars being fought inside partner management teams, megalomaniacal leadership, complete dismantling of meritocracy (faster promos if you sit in US)......the list goes on and on</p> review2889: Very difficult hiring process No accountability in various teams No quality reviews in the pilot teams</p> review2890: It should give much better facilities to developer, and give full access to its upcoming technology.</p> review2890: little creativity allowed micro-management, tight control over processes hard to get promoted bureaucracy and general slowness the whole system of performance reviews promotes mediocrity and following procedures rather than innovation lots of talk, little action is a popular approach to work among employees (=lots of low performers that never get noticed)</p> review2891: Career progression slow Can be very invasive if you socialise extensively with your colleagues Dublin office opportunities lesser than local office opportunities</p> review2892: Some part of the management</p> review2893: I can say there are not lot many downsides for the company but, as there is very close competition between employee to employee the growth opportunities may be very few not reaching most of the employees which inturn reflecting the hikes.</p> review2894: Metrics are increasing quarterly, sometimes quite beyond the team capabilities, but because the team is stromd they are usually met.</p> review2895: Senior management. Too much politics.</p> review2896: Free food made me slightly fat and I am too lazy to use the free gym. Many great things happen in US, this make it difficult to get involved in them when working outside US. I am still working on great stuff, but have less choice.</p> review2897: No attention given to emerging markets</p> review2898: bigger and bigger, the benefit and composition is not so attractive than before.</p> review2899: so far, none worthy to be considered a con.</p> review2899: Nothing Nothing Nothing and Nothing</p> review2900: Could allow offices outside MtView to adapt strategy to local needs</p> review2901: Lack of pre placement information.</p> review2902: People, ability to influence the business, career path</p> review2903: lack of challenges, no career opportunities, bad management</p> review2904: Little opportunity to gain management experience early on if you have no prior experience as a manager.</p> review2905: company is getting bigger and more bureacratic 100% focus on product and making product the king</p> review2906: You have to reach $100 to receive a payment. Your job is not stable, no regularization. So it really depends on your website</p> review2907: Selling Ads is not what I have in mind of doing something meaningful</p> review2908: ... as long as productivity is there. Work life balance is possible, but you won&#039;t get promoted if you work &#034;only&#034; 40 hours a week.</p> review2908: No Work Life balance. Work on weekends. Salary is not up to the mark.</p> review2909: Lack of communication between management and employees</p> review2910: Long hours with many long tasks that may not release your creativity but overall good</p> review2911: For some teams, the structure is too flat so that the efficiency is not very good. Risk management is still very new to all the teams and still need lots of education efforts</p> review2912: - Could get slightly bureaucratic</p> review2913: Very smart team/people makes it hard to really stand out. Ever increasing company size leading to more middle management.</p> review2914: - work may not be that great (India operations ) - like any other organization a great deal depends on the kind of manager you get</p> review2915: very fast paced, constant change, too many opportunities sometimes confuse the employees, usually need to work in virtual teams which might be difficult for someone who is not used to video conferences</p> review2916: No cons really; the challenge is to keep the culture intact</p> review2917: hard work, huge workload and sometimes too challenge, maybe be overlooked</p> review2917: I do not think there are any cons compared to other medium-big companies.</p> review2918: No retention at Google. Google is a performance driven company and if you don&#039;t perform or cannot catch up with others, you&#039;ll likely to be kept in the icebox.</p> review2919: Nothing as of now as I haven&#039;t completed atleast a year</p> review2920: - You acquire a lot of non-transferable skills</p> review2921: It&#039;s getting into &#034;big corporation&#034; mode. Although company wants to fight it, there is some red-tape. Also, on lower levels of organization, one can get lost in insignificant little things - working for manager who works for manager who works for manager ... etc, has it&#039;s toll.</p> review2922: poor career development, pulled to too many directions, poor middle management, very competitive if you want to get promoted, forget about work life balance.</p> review2923: None, as it&#039;s all relative and really depends on how you decide to take things.</p> review2924: - remote offices (ie. in Europe) are only sources for MTV to get Engineers from, they never get somewhat interesting or promising projects - remote offices live their own life and are not Google as it should be - so many cultural issues! - all workers are being discriminated by the colour of their badges - if you have a red one you will not be allowed to a Friday meeting and dishes and will never get any benefits as new year presents, massage, trips to Disneyland and even bonuses and kudos - very political organization - if you are not playing rude political games and just working hard forget about career at Google - if you&#039;ve accomplished 120% of your targets you are a loser because the guy from other office did 121% - there&#039;s no work/life balance as you are tied to the office. You even do not have an opportunity to have your lunch outside because there are cafes and food points in the office. No personal life, only ambitious plans of your managers!</p>  review2925: While everyone is allowed to question the company&#039;s decisions, senior management are getting better at dodging them. Making a career for yourself can be very difficult unless you are exceedingly brilliant. There are a lot of very, very smart people here.</p> review2926: High competition and takes alot of time for you to get recognized.</p> review2926: No organized approach to problems. No standardization in writing code. There is nothing as writing code as a team. Too much dependability on person for a tool. No collaboration among team members.</p> review2927: There&#039;s still a glass ceiling for user experience and there may always be at Google. Data rules all decisions, no matter how auspicious it&#039;s origin. Also, like in distributed offices still feels remote and looks to be only be consolidating towards Mountain View. And work / life balance? No such thing.</p> review2928: Sometimes working long hours can be a bit of a hassle</p> review2929: I am unable to recall any cons with this firm</p> review2930: - very high volume of work - very political; - talended people are not rewarded; - no careers opportunities - no life/balance (you need to go out every week to be promoted)</p> review2931: living in Ireland and that&#039;s it</p> review2932: Career growth is dicey, not too sure about the long-term. I&#039;ve not been here long enough to comment on office politics though.</p> review2933: You feel like a small cog in a big machine</p> review2934: there are no cons at Google</p> review2935: Is there Work Life balance?</p> review2935: Hectic Schedule and maximum work load</p> review2936: Everybody wants to know what you&#039;re working on (secret). People ask personal google favors of you.</p> review2937: Not very structured for growth</p> review2938: A lot of segregation amongst teams - maybe it&#039;s just me but it feels a bit too &#039;college-y&#039; at times but I suppose that&#039;s a pro/con based on your individual tastes. Promotion routes can be a bit vague. Hard to maintain &#039;Work/Life Balance&#039; but that&#039;s sales, right...</p> review2939: long term stay is a question due to office politics</p> review2940: can be very busy sometimes</p> review2941: No place for faint hearted</p> review2942: Payscale, regional movement, horizontal movement</p> review2943: Internally competitive as most of the employees are smart</p> review2944: No permanent contract, vendors do have the leadership on site</p> review2944: Sometimes management decisions and their motivations are not optimally clear. This could also be due to the rapid growth of the company and the number of projects.</p> review2945: Very discrete &amp; hypothetical questions</p> review2946: I don&#039;t really know of a con of working at Google. The only thing I can think of is that it is interesting to see how it is really run as an American company in a sense that there are some strict policy rules to uphold.</p> review2947: Nothing Can Say about Google...</p> review2948: Some people tend to get lost in work.</p> review2949: Balancing work life is a challenge. Looking for a cushy job this is not the place to be</p> review2950: - Office is too small. It is like working for a family-owned business, so include all the cons of that. - Many people quit or are laid-off in their first or second year. So think about that before moving your life to that city. There is no other relevant software company there. - Many extra hours. - Micro management. It was the only job I ever had that my manager came to my desk and complained that I was not typing. - Not much going on. Since the office is small, you don&#039;t have many projects to choose, if you could choose. - No mobility. It is the only Google office in Brazil to have software engineer positions. - Forget about 20% projects, unless you use your &#034;free&#034; time for that.</p> review2951: it does not have any defects</p> review2952: Sometimes a bit political and can be a lot of travelling. Working long hours and work/life balance can be sometimes tricky</p> review2953: Big big place.. you may get ignored</p> review2953: Very competitive environment Slow promotion cycles Information overload</p> review2954: None that comes to the mind</p> review2955: If you don&#039;t have a phd, you would be writing naive code (its true)</p> review2956: Sometimes you might not get recognised for your efforts mainly if the management in charge doesn&#039;t understand very well the mechanics of the workflow</p> review2957: I&#039;m very satisfied with Career Opportunities, Compensation &amp; Benefits, Work/Life Balance, Culture &amp; Values</p> review2958: worst idea to leave the place</p> review2959: Difficult to move internally, harder than expected Promotional cycles are more political than expected and tricky to navigate More politics in general than expected In the Sales Org side, too many managers are &#039;old-school&#039; ad/media types which makes them very much an &#039;old boys club&#039; and this doesn&#039;t mesh well with the Google culture itself.</p> review2960: well, working in a big and good company, it is very stressed to work on challenging problems. And since it is also hard to be promoted since a single person is not very important to a big company.</p> review2961: Serious dead bodies at certain offices. Some managers kind to older timers and allow harracement as long as you perform.</p> review2962: The problem is that most people in Dublin are far from home since this is the european HQ. The weather in Dublin doesn&#039;t help at all :)</p> review2962: Weak management Difficult to maintain work-life balance Too US-centric</p> review2963: Compensation for the non-engineering staff is below market standard.</p> review2964: work-life balance not existent if you don&#039;t watch out due to few hierarchy levels career development is tough</p> review2965: No cons. You need to google it to know cons :)</p> review2966: lobotomizing work (why hie ivy league graduates for monkey jobs ????). extremely heavy hierarchy, hidden under a country club coating. low pay.</p> review2967: not so good team members</p> review2968: None at the time I was there. Very positive organizational culture.</p> review2969: Nothing in particular. I have been working here for more than 5 years.</p> review2970: Work-life balance could be better. Sometimes extreme competition takes a toll on you.</p> review2971: Competitive Sometimes difficult to get promoted</p> review2971: No career path Lack of opportunities outside Mountain View Lower salary compared to SWE and SWET</p> review2972: - Slow career progression: it is more and more difficult to progress the career within the company as it becomes bigger. - Repetitive job: job may become repetitive after a short time.</p> review2973: The Google Maps project cannot be compared to the actual Google company. Employees are hired through agencies and there is no contract extension after 2 years (no exceptions). The food provided is limited though better than in other companies. I feel like the company uses your talents (leadership/attention to detail etc), gives you additional projects (=hope to get an extension, a lot of attention) and than lets you go without even blinking, replacing you with anybody else. This can be frustrating. Another con is the lack of flexibility reg. time management-you can never work back even 15 minutes.</p> review2974: Confined career ladder makes it difficult to think ahead.</p> review2975: Company is starting to loose it&#039;s start up roots. Starting to feel very corporate.</p> review2976: Work life balance Promotion takes a long time</p> review2977: - Getting harder to be in remote office with less oppurtunities</p> review2978: Difficult interview process, competitive environment.</p> review2979: 1. Technologies used not applicable outside company</p> review2980: NO Cons to say,it is awesome</p> review2980: Very limited career opportunity in satellite offices, which however is not acknowledged by management.</p> review2981: Most intelligent coworkers you could ever imagine can lead to impostor syndrome. You need to be careful to balance your work and personal life, but the drive to sometimes work too hard comes from within when you work at Google; it&#039;s not something that&#039;s pushed on you by the company or colleagues.</p> review2982: Not much I can think of.</p> review2983: Becoming more bureaucratic as it grows larger. Cost cutting really seems to be targeted at the &#034;little people&#034;, rather than execs who still seem to do what they want.</p> review2984: Google is honestly such a wonderful company, it will be hard to ever consider leaving. I&#039;d advise Graduates who want to see more of the industry to learn their trade somewhere else, then work for the best!</p> review2985: Humility goes a long way at Google but there are still those that use traditional methods of advancement by trying to be the loudest voice or most long-winded in a room. I think this probably goes for most large companies no matter where you are.</p> review2986: It&#039;s a mess sometimes ... lack of</p> review2987: Monotonous work initially. Very little learning from the initial work. You need to get a new role before you can start learning more.</p> review2988: Questionable compensation strategy, poor individual org management</p> review2989: None, I had a great time at Google</p> review2989: As at any big company, there are political battles. Sometimes grungy engineering work gets ignored in the face of shinier/sexier stuff (but I would say that is well-known, hard to fix, and actively being worked on).</p> review2990: Very corporate. Work is often unfulfilling</p> review2991: You get lots of questions about working at Google.</p> review2992: Process oriented Little scope to experiment</p> review2993: long hours may affect work life balance</p> review2994: There are not many opportunities for technical roles in this office, but this depends on specific offices. The base salary is not exciting, compared to other offers you can get from competitors.</p> review2995: Need to put a lot of hours if you want to get promoted fast</p> review2996: They&#039;ve become puppets of the corporate culture of the bottom line mentality at cost to their clients. All they do now is fight legal battles and gouge clients budgets. Sad. Lots of turnover there. If you don&#039;t do what they want-they let you go-even if it&#039;s unethical.</p> review2997: Very difficult to get job</p> review2998: - Company is getting big and this is stifling innovation. - Too many metrics in place to measure success</p> review2998: Unclear career progression, huge firm so little chance of rising through the ranks, employees pitted against each other, questionable hiring decisions (especially at management level), unclear policies, competitive atmosphere, middle management brought in (usually) from outside Google and don&#039;t always understand/fit the culture</p> review2999: Promotion process quite unfair Bureaucracy Politics Lack of design spirit</p> review3000: - None, I am absolutely satisfied!</p> review3001: * Not many projects to choose from * Hard to grow after reaching a certain level</p> review3002: Environment was great when I joined in early 2007, although everything changed with time. Management stop listening. Coworkers started backstabbing. I felt like I was producing fried air.</p> review3003: I wish the salary was slightly higher, but overall, I very much enjoy working at Google.</p> review3004: It can sometimes get very busy and there is not enough resources to work on everything that needs to be done.</p> review3005: work-life balance, hierarchy, inconsistent leadership</p> review3006: innovation jungle which is good and bad</p> review3007: Too short of an internship to comment.</p> review3007: Slow growth in terms of roles, It&#039;s hard to fill in this space with 20 words as there are not many cons. career development is the only area where I feel they should make some changes.</p> review3008: Very competitive - can be hard for career progression Engineering outside the US can be challenging</p> review3009: Career management is non-existent. Expect to have reviews where - despite having surpassed all set targets - you get told that you didn&#039;t do enough to best the best guy in the team, and therefore you can wait a bit before you can receive promotions.</p> review3010: some functions can be bureaucratic, but overall still a very nimble co given its size</p> review3011: Once people enter Google, after entering straight out of undergraduate college, they believe that they have achieved a big feat and get high on attitude and relax too much and messes up the culture a bit, but that&#039;s okay.</p> review3012: Can not think of many cons. Location maybe as I prefered other city. I find less scope for research oriented work</p> review3013: Very hard to get promoted.</p> review3014: Bureaucracy Government Like Innovation Shrinking</p> review3015: Beyond a point in time there is stagnation in career as vertical movement is less.</p> review3016: Can be chaotic, but often in a generative way. Its superb internal expertise can make it slightly arrogent in its views to the outside world.</p> review3016: Not for those who aren&#039;t willing to give it 110% and work hard for it. Work-life balance isn&#039;t impossible, but you have to be extremely efficient and effective in order to achieve some degree of balance.</p> review3017: Bureaucracy creeping in with the big size you have to be really good to really stand out coz everyone is good</p> review3018: No Cons :) Its been absolutely amazing!!</p> review3019: Google doesn&#039;t really seem to understand UX. Design decisions are often made by committee and based on technology or what the VP likes. The UX designer then gets the job of painting the pixels. There&#039;s also little understanding of the different roles within UX (visual designer, interaction designer, researcher). I find the work very simple and repetitive do miss the more interesting bits of UX design (conceptual, strategical work)</p> review3020: Death by Powerpoint, somewhat slow moving. As the company has been on a crest of a wave it feels sometimes that there is not really much point to the work. The best things about the company are also the worst things about it, in that there is a lot of waste of time and money.</p> review3021: nothing... do well with simple coding skills</p> review3022: No proper salary hikes and promotions there is no growthy in career</p> review3023: Work &amp; Life balance, office locations</p> review3024: No career track, slow career advancement, wrong person for the wrong job</p> review3025: If you work in a remote location and end up in a project that is not a fit for you, there is not many oportunities to move to another project.</p> review3025: Pro + Con: sometimes levels needed for Career, sometimes not. Big company has always the challenge to make you just a one of many.</p> review3026: - Sales is cock-up - Management is appalling, with few exceptions - They manage to make every job in Sales unnecessarily boring and stressful - Career and promotion feel like gambling - Professional growth is very difficult, since your manager is usually not very clever</p> review3027: Too much red tape and political games</p> review3028: An excessive email culture - so many emails!</p> review3029: some manager don&#039;t fit for the role. Weak Management style.</p> review3030: people work inefficient, since the company is too big, you will find you are very small. And there is some office politics there. make you feel depressed.</p> review3031: You&#039;re never really off the clock - I get emails past midnight and can&#039;t get away with not checking email at night or on the weekends. It&#039;s also becoming more hierarchical and top down. There is far less of that start-up spirit than when the company was younger. Size - with so many employees, it&#039;s easy to feel like one of the many minions.</p> review3032: With all the smart people around it&#039;s not that easy to get promoted.</p> review3033: Not many opportunities except in headquarter offices.</p> review3034: Hard to juggle work with a family</p> review3034: - When you work at the topmost company that is already successful, you miss the chance to work in a start-up environment</p> review3035: It actually has none as far as I could find. You name anything and Google had already thought of it and worked upon it.</p> review3036: I did not feel there were any</p> review3037: Difficult to get a promotion (you may get frustrated after a while), often have to work late, working from home is rarely an option, not so many career opportunities outside Mountain View, the most interesting projects are focused there.</p> review3038: Cant think of any right now</p> review3039: - the warm and friendly corporate culture has dwindled to resemble the more typical corporate culture with underhanded politics and favoritism being the keys to success - work / life balance could be better. a lot of times there is peer pressure to be constantly working or give off the perception that one is always on the clock. the company does provide a laptop, cell phone and pay for your home internet (which is obviously great) but it is also to enable this sort of mentality</p> review3040: - Like any large company, there&#039;s some degree of bureaucracy - It can be a bit more difficult to impact the organization when working outside of Mountain View</p> review3041: Changes too fast. culture fading away. Dublin no longer the hub for the sales team</p> review3042: Most of the Workforce is very young</p> review3043: the process of performance review might be more transparent. It is also highly dependent on your manager, which can be a positive and negative aspect at the same time. Role of an AdWords associate is prone to routine after certain period of time.</p> review3043: I am not sure, because this company strong</p> review3044: Misuse and Manipulation of search results, Privacy, Copyright, and Censorship.</p> review3045: Not too many really to Say</p> review3046: I thought the culture was a little alpha-male dominant and could edge out the quieter types. Depending on your manager there could be very little interest in your promotions, etc.</p> review3047: Too many freebies, one get too used to it :)</p> review3048: Easy to get caught up in bureaucracy. Not being based in California can be an issue.</p> review3049: Honestly can&#039;t think of any..</p> review3050: People tend to stay here for many hours of the week, since there are so many reasons to stay</p> review3051: Getting too big, lots of politics, and limited career paths for non-technical or non-engineering folks.</p> review3052: In my experience, I haven&#039;t come across any cons as Google really do take care of their employees. The work can be hard sometimes but I like challenges!</p> review3052: Monotonous work process. The process in itself is not very dynamic.</p> review3053: You process over 10x as much email as you otherwise would with another company. I view this as a pretty fun challenge but I know it can bury some people. It isn&#039;t unheard of to have ~5-10K+ unread emails in a box...all somehow seeming urgent. With 50K+ employees, it can be tough to navigate the structure when seeking an answer. People rotate through teams often and this means you have to be very resourceful and sharp to solve challenges in cross-product-team scenarios. Thought it&#039;s fun and exciting to work here, you may find yourself looking at the clock to notice that you&#039;ve been at work for 12 hours. I suppose this says something good about the desire to be there without counting the hours away, but takes its toll on your social &amp; personal life schedule if you&#039;re not careful to balance it well.</p> review3054: only sales career unless you have engineering degree too much burocracy very poor middle management too much internal politics</p> review3055: Company is too successful; people get complacent; increasingly engineers that need to be told what to do.</p> review3056: Turning into a larger, more mature organisation; some less important or smaller projects are often cancelled; harder to start up new innovative projects.</p> review3057: differentiation between the full timers and part timers salary compensation breaking structure not so rewarding politics between the employers and favoritism towards certain employees needs to be minimised</p> review3058: I really can&#039;t think of anything. There may be times where you feel the work isn&#039;t right for you, but it&#039;s big enough that you&#039;re able to move to a project and location that suits you.</p> review3059: Too much of a stress on technology, non tech guys might feel dissapointed.. it is a tech company, so non tech jobs may feel a bit unvalued for at times.</p> review3060: Smart teammates can be intimidating, the company has grown quite large and it&#039;s difficult to communicate across the org, transferring teams is much more difficult than it used to be.</p> review3061: Peer pressure as promotion cycle is extremely regulated and you get quarterly ratings based on performance.</p> review3061: Frequent re-organizations Not much importance to remote offices</p> review3062: Overqualified for very basic jobs. They act fussy about recruitment but still don&#039;t provide anything challenging to entry level employees in the sales and adwords department at least in the Indian office. Also the perks don&#039;t make up for the poor take home salary.</p> review3063: A lot of great people around you. The company has grown quite big by now. So you have to work really hard for promotions. If it can be considered a con, the overwhelming variety of great food around you makes it very tough to control westline :)</p> review3064: Work can get stressful sometimes and you have to slog it out inorder to get a promotion/bonus.</p> review3065: Too many product closure. Less Visibility</p> review3066: Nothing that I can think off.</p> review3067: ppl have sometimes complained a bit abt the management, or about the salaries (AdWords salaries) or about</p> review3068: - The spirit is gone - Unengaged, unless it&#039;s an OKR of course, employees - Devoid of passion - People-hostile - The business is not focused on clients one bit at all, - The business main focus is on visibility, creating endless trix (excel) sheets and meaningless presentations - The success algorithm (yeah, so sue me Google for revealing the secret): manipulate as much as you can, never speak the truth, learn how to wear as many masks as possible (except your own authentic self of course), produce many slides and many trix sheets, fill them with McKinsey-like business gibberish and clichés that mean absolutely nothing, join lots of meetings and just say something (preferably McKinskey-like business gibberish), smile a lot and make sure to please the dictat ... sorry, managers at all cost, typically by participating in their projects carrying out tasks that you are by far vastly overqualified so they can look good in front of their bosses, who in turn can lo ok good in front of their boss and so on. Carrying out orders, mindlessly, is much more rewarded than actually doing something meaningful and innovative and thinking for yourself. - By no means think for yourself - Very little transparency - Extremely poor management - Hell, if you thought management sucked wait &#039;til you get a closer look at their leadership qualities and what goes on behind closed doors ... - False smiles and a sense of &#034;things are great and perky&#034; - Fear of speaking the truth - Performance system which is constantly being sold in one way by HRBP but in reality is the complete opposite which everyone knows is unfair, unbalanced, subjective, tyrannical, biased, playing out one employee against another, obliterates corporation and serves as the only control mechanism for shitty managers that fail to motivate their teams - Trust me, the list goes on and on at &#034;the best place to work&#034; but I&#039;ll stop here for now</p> review3069: Change is constant at Google. We hire people who are flexible, but not all react well to change.</p> review3070: Small fish, big pond, maturing company.</p> review3070: Absolutely no work life balance. Deteriorating health conditions thereafter.</p> review3071: Always need to be on top of your game Can never slack</p> review3072: Overweening arrogance, pervasive not-invented-here syndrome, limited range of positions.</p> review3073: None that I can think of right now</p> review3074: Mostly natural consequences of being in a large company. There&#039;s lots of politics, processes and bureaucracy. Different groups manage in different ways - be sure you know and are comfortable with the metrics used in the group you&#039;re talking to. If you don&#039;t agree with them, you probably won&#039;t enjoy being here.</p> review3075: There are no cons in specific.</p> review3076: you really need to work hard to sustain.and you must be thorough with your engineering skills.very competitive enviornment.</p> review3077: No paid overtime work life balance can be difficult to maintain Advancement is very arbitrary depending on manager</p> review3078: Large company mars innovation, sales teams far from engineering teams</p> review3079: The job contents is very much routine driven and as such can get very boring after a while (as somebody else already stated, Dublin is a glorified call centre). Targets improve every quarter resulting in a constant sales pressure. Given that Google is the absolute market leader by miles, they don&#039;t really care about their customers (except if you are a very big one like Coca Cola). For people in customer-facing roles this is very frustrating. If Google would treat its customers only half as good as their employees, it would already be a massive improvement. You need to be very flexible since there are constant reorganisations. Changing desk locations, teams or team leaders multiple teams per quarter is no exception. A lot of people are very career driven and only focused on achieving targets, resulting in a tense atmosphere (co-workers are often seen as competitors for promotion instead of colleagues).</p> review3079: not too good IT, high targets one must fullfill in order to get a decent salary</p> review3080: Job profile is not great</p> review3081: Not easy to develop one&#039;s career in remote offices. Remote offices are very restricted recently.</p> review3082: becoming too big and corporation like. there is not as much innovation as before.</p> review3083: little mobility between the different offices</p> review3084: Frustrating because everything must be created from scratch. Experience is often seen as a handicap, because everyone at Google is smarter than everyone else on Earth and therefore whatever was done before is inferior.</p> review3085: Basic compensation is poor.Compensation goes by Industry benchmarking, which isn&#039;t a great metric to judge simply because the online industry doesn&#039;t have a wider market yet</p> review3086: - Cult-like mentality - Regional offices get little recognition / respect - Overseas offices are disconnected from HQ which can create toxic, &#034;clannish&#034; environments - Calibre of overseas employees is generally weaker - Promotion is difficult to come by and relies on self-branding - Weak middle and upper management - more managers care about advancing themselves versus advancing their team members - Few career opportunities</p> review3087: Low chances of growth after a point</p> review3088: Stiff Competition, slow growth and flat hierarchy.</p> review3088: Challenging career development, challenging business goals.</p> review3089: Remote office, less opportunity to work on next big thing.</p> review3090: Getting bigger, and move slower</p> review3091: Sometimes a limited access to operations and no compatibility between teams I feel..which are interconnected in a project.</p> review3092: But then...if you&#039;re looking to grow beyond a point, and not be invlovled in crazy office politics or want salaries that are up to the mark according to industry standards...you shouldn&#039;t be here. Yes, they pamper you. So much so that you forget that professionally you&#039;re probably not doing much at all. But that only lasts, 2..3...or even 4 years. Before you realize what is really happening.</p> review3093: Extremely poor management structure. Years ago, managers would work with you to further your career, and encourage professional growth. Now, you can barely get a &#034;meet expectations&#034;, when you don&#039;t even know what those expectations are, since they are constantly changing, often without the employee knowing. Absolutely no guidance, mentoring, or pro active advice ... almost feels like they want you to fail, and do what they can to facilitate it. Also, far, far too much nepotism in upper management...it&#039;s like they are in the &#034;Cool kids Club&#034;, and those not in management are outcasts, especially those who have been there much longer than they have.</p> review3094: long hours urban jungle type feel can get overwhelming</p> review3095: constant reorganizations create high stress levels, also, there is a lot of red tape and double think going on so heightens the need to be politically aware.</p> review3096: An Indian management which believes in following diktats from California and does not have the guts to challenge them, an appraisal system which is opaque and biased towards yes men and women and based on everything else apart from performance. An HR system which gives more credence to brand than to talent and where only one talent rules - communication skills.</p> review3097: The potential of grow in Google is limited since the progress is tend to slow recently.</p> review3097: None Everything is good But still can work on vendor management</p> review3098: They might neglect you sometimes because of work load.</p> review3099: My experience here is limited, but most of the people I know who started around the same time as me have identical complaints: Google doesn&#039;t want thinkers for the majority of their engineers, they want short-order cooks and yes-men. In all my career, the only place I&#039;ve worked that was even comparable to Google was Wells Fargo (which was a ridiculously unfulfilling place to work as an engineer). Additionally, the culture at Google is very snobby compared to other places I&#039;ve worked. Managers love to reiterate lines like &#034;we hire the smartest people in the world&#034;, and a lot of people seem to eat it up. One could argue that this is harmless placating, but the level of groupthink present all over the organization is appalling. Many even consider &#034;not invented here&#034; a legitimate reason to build something from scratch, even when there&#039;s more robust free software out there (I&#039;ve been pressured into doing this several times,  since the approval process for 3rd party code is so painstakingly bureaucratic). Lastly, I don&#039;t feel valued, respected, or even acknowledged by managers. I end up working nights and weekends every week because of clear organizational mistakes being made by managers or other teams. I have been told personally by a manager that a reason for me being pigeonholed into a role I hated was because I didn&#039;t go to a top tier school (since another placation they often throw around is that Google is way harder to get into than an Ivy League school, this does once again seem irrelevant). The worst part is that most people don&#039;t listen about these things; the times I&#039;ve told people that we are underorganized and it&#039;s going to cause problems later, the general response is to ignore it and/or not be proactive.</p> review3100: 1. Slowing moving towards bureaucracy 2. In India Indian managers are after all Indian so Google US/EU/AUS is much better than India.</p> review3101: you have to work very hard.It is very hard to find out spare time for yourself.</p> review3102: 1. Everybody is very very career focused, they mostly dont have any other aspiration in life. So they spent a lot of hour in office. And it creates tremendous peer pressure. 2. 80% of the current employee are college hires in last 1/2/3 years. Also there are lots of food and facilities in office, so they spent days and nights in office, even weekends. 3. If you want a stable work pressure, with stable work life balance, and other interest than the job, this is not your place for sure. 4. If you have 5-10 years of experience, and want to join Google, as your career pick, it will be hard to sustain it, coz if you think you will spend stable work hours, and dont need promotion etc, you will be odd man out, and your feedbacks will be bad. 5. Middle management is not that efficient, they all hired/get promoted because they are all great developers, now managing different people, getting most out of them, etc are not their cup of tea.</p> review3103: Sometimes too much work pressure..</p> review3104: Hard to get promoted. Getting a bit more hierarchical and less of the great atmosphere it used to have.</p> review3105: slow growth is the only con</p> review3106: Compensation could be better at initial levels</p> review3106: Still need more transparency in the system</p> review3107: Not any that I know of.</p> review3108: Do not take action timely and corrective action against management.</p> review3109: Working in Google for 80% of the time felt like working in a factory; churning out the same work day after day, being programmed in to what to say or do and not using always putting the long term thoughts of clients/relationship with clients at the heart. Short term targets do not always win (in my opinion).</p> review3110: very hard to earn some pennies</p> review3111: The reward system is strongly biased toward &#039;launches&#039;, i.e. new features, new products. You can&#039;t get promoted by doing incremental improvements. But there is only so much new features/products really worth doing...So if you are the kind of person who likes to fix bugs, refactor bad code instead of inventing useless new features, this may not be the best place for you.</p> review3112: extremely competitive environment; not for the faint hearted</p> review3113: - The frills can spoil you! One should try to maintain a balance while availing them.</p> review3114: Google might not be the right place for you if you don&#039;t know how to navigate ambiguity and get things done with minimal oversight. Need to be able to influence across functions.</p> review3115: Lot of de-frag in remote sites</p> review3115: Indian setup is looked as a BPO/KPO</p> review3116: the work is not very satisfying. No job satisfaction. The brain gets jammed from not working.</p> review3117: Hard to progress further within the company. Work is repetitive and biased ratings. Poor middle management. Too much pressure resulting in bad work/life balance.</p> review3118: The interviews focus on algorithms so you need to spend a lot of time preparing for that.</p> review3119: Google has a hard time delegating responsibility to remote offices. Projects started abroad would consistently be pulled into Mountain View as soon as they showed signs of success. This did not work well for remote employees who were left marginalised and unrewarded for their efforts.</p> review3120: Starting salary is low, but increases over time</p> review3121: The product that we were working on at our startup was shutdown. Assimilated to other parts of the firm where it definitely felt like a big corporation with little ownership and plenty of politics.</p> review3122: timings are very ackword and irritating</p> review3123: - compensation - growth - evaluation - rewards</p> review3124: Sometimes a little TOO fun at work.</p> review3124: too much of unnecessary options..</p> review3125: very distributed teams, very high standards</p> review3126: sometimes monotonous makes you unfit for other organizations. lots of benefits</p> review3127: too much email, perhaps over competitiveness, invisible middle management (for me), too much hierarchy (in some areas), international offices not prioritised</p> review3128: Its run like a start up so it can be chaotic at times. Departments are spread way too thin as we had to cancel really nice projects because the workload would become unacceptably high (for Google norms).</p> review3129: Career progression can be tough to get Some cocky coworkers who think they are the best Work can be repetitive and not particularly challenging</p> review3130: I cannot think of any cons over the top of my head at the moment but there have been very few moments where something didn&#039;t go/happen as I expected. The cross all your expectations most of the time. Employee satisfation is very important to them</p> review3131: Eventhough they try very hard to allow for geographical movements for employees, it is not always easy to get a posting out of your country. It is more true for employees working in the Asia region, to move to Europe. Sometimes you need a strong manager to recommend you and enable you to take up a role you covet.</p> review3132: It&#039;s a large company, not a startup.</p> review3133: Sometimes a lot of work</p> review3133: Brand name company, learning opportunity from colleagues they are all very smart and talented, great working environment. good company in general.</p> review3134: No real cons that I can point out. Large projects mean you can feel like an insignificant cog in the machine.</p> review3135: Management, Salary Compensation, vendor contractors,</p> review3136: Some parts of the company have a frantic work pace to the extent of being permanently stressful Engineering driven company, which is a con in that other job roles need to define and figure out how they fit in the development process User experience especially research is not uniformly baked in the process. I feel I have spent a lot of time explaining to people what I can do for them</p> review3137: Politics are too much in some groups. Some people in the management form an opinion about some members of the team without knowing them.</p> review3138: Too big to be flexible</p> review3139: Since Larry became CEO, things have changed. Things have become more and more top-down and even the SVPs have assumed &#034;dictatorial&#034; role. Starting anything new requires approval, distributed offices are treated like filth.</p> review3140: 1) Too huge a company.</p> review3141: time mainly shift timing starting</p> review3142: Progressing in the career may be a lengthy process. Sometimes you&#039;re better off leaving to another company to get work experience and try to return later to Google to get hired into a higher position.</p> review3142: I think there are so many layers of middle management that it&#039;s impossible to feel connected to the top. Especially if you aren&#039;t in the US, which is where most the exciting stuff happens. There is constant restructuring and it&#039;s not clear how the goals of management trickle down. They claim to be a flat company but I&#039;m not convinced.</p> review3143: Lack or order Everything decided essentially by &#034;committee vote&#034; over email</p> review3144: high competitive environment Up to down decisions and organisation structure Expectation of success on these up to down decisions without localizing them.</p> review3145: sucky management. blundering planning processes fell apart. lots of finger pointing</p> review3146: Outdated propriety stack NIH syndrom No customer focus Lack of accountability</p> review3147: - No career prospects unless you&#039;re already at a very senior role or you want to follow the &#034;managerial path&#034; -- not all people are tailored (or want) to be people&#039;s managers (only 34% of my former managers were), hence the bad reputation around middle-management; - Increasing workload as you progress in the role... ... which makes it hard to keep a work-life balance, specially when you&#039;re working across different time zones; - Given the extra hours you need to put in to do all the work, not so competitive compensation package after all... - Not so glamorous work for most people (Dublin is mostly a glorified call center); - Insane workload every couple of quarters, around each review cycle; - Too many unhealthy snacks around...</p> review3148: Highly stressful environment, long hours</p> review3149: Interview process could be better</p> review3150: Lower growth potential, lack of work life balance</p> review3151: Long hours, not very structured</p> review3151: Unprofessional. Poor leadership. No career growth. Poor planning. Unstructured. No rewards or acknowledgment for doing good work.</p> review3152: Clicks!! A bunch of geeks who have no idea how to handle &#034;Real Life&#034; issues. Procedures are very monotonous. My day consist of filling out the same form 5 different ways which takes up about 3/4 of my 8 hour shift. Never have I seen such inexperienced management get paid for doing nothing.</p> review3153: very competitive, there are some free riders from early years</p> review3154: Some of the downsides to working at Google are that it&#039;s not as exciting as a job as one might think.</p> review3155: It is a 30K people company now. Hiring too fast.</p> review3156: Some managers are better than others</p> review3157: very brand conscious. They go only to the so called best schools/colleges thus missing out on some real geeks out there in the open</p> review3158: More political environment Additional bureaucratic processes, loss of start up mentality. Only focus on revenue Lack of career development High employee churn</p> review3159: long work hours and tough dead lines!</p> review3160: Well, we have some first world problems. I don&#039;t see mountains from my window. And sometimes there is no flavorless cottage cheese and I need to eat onion one, which I don&#039;t like.</p> review3160: Favouritism, politics, scale, not a startup anymore</p> review3161: In my case, lack of recognition of the results obtained</p> review3162: - career progression opportunities are close to zero - some people that started there many years ago just hold on to their roles and it&#039;s hard for the newcomers to prove they are potentially better</p> review3163: boring job impossible have a carrier treat as second level google employee</p> review3164: Too many smart people, so it&#039;s hard to get promoted, especially in remote offices. It&#039;s hard, really hard, and challenging.</p> review3165: Can be unappreciated at times. The lack of processes can be frustrating at times.</p> review3166: getting a bit bit which means more and more restrictions are in place for movement and growth, but still not as bad as other places.</p> review3167: Hearing from them takes forever.</p> review3168: The staffing organization does not feel like it&#039;s part of the rest of the campus. The company is too large to really feel like your contributions are noticed. Processes are already set in place so there isn&#039;t really much room for any creative approach to recruiting.</p> review3169: I have seen really bad examples of middle management… great contrast with the potential in younger people Politics are more important than work… you would not expect it in this company (only me?) Innovation? depending on what you do… Your progress depends on favoritism, that reflects in your ratings, that make it possible for you to progress… you can have great ratings if your manager likes you, even if your performance is not that good If you are not in the right project, you get no visibility Growing size leads to difficulty in taking quick decisions Performance ratings are not always fair. For example, if you get a promotion you definitely can&#039;t get a good rating next quarter There is not an impartial HR representative in case you have problems with your manager Very often over qualified people for basic positions, and lack of possibilities to change - make sure you know what you will do before joining! Work/life balance depending on your manager -  was not able to play fussball in months (yes, I am motivated, but don&#039;t want to work on weekends to get a promotion) Managers find metrics that make no sense and measure the team on a curve they themselves could never meet. New learning for me: not only pro-motion but de-motion as well exists Referral system not clear: referred bright people that could not get hired</p> review3169: Slowly becoming a corporation like Microsoft.</p> review3170: Internal communication between teams can be challenging</p> review3171: long hours. can be draining at times</p> review3172: Bias towards quick and dirty solutions. Lack of understanding that the target user is not a software engineer at google.</p> review3173: you cannot focus on the actual work cos reorgs are happening all the time, everything is so disorganized and chaotic.</p> review3174: Things get done kind of slowly.</p> review3175: The management und processes sometimes seem to be a unstructured. The promotion process is usually very formal and inflexible.</p> review3176: There are frequent organizational and/or structural changes within the organization.</p> review3177: Work is myopic for the talent level they demand, very political environment. Not the company it was n 2005</p> review3178: Hard work if you are not based in MTV (this may not be the case if you are not in engineering)</p> review3178: The rate of change can upset people; nothing is constant. If you think you are making progress on your project, it&#039;s time to receive an email about deprecating an old database API or requiring every product to integrate the latest greatest security technology. Because the company has shown it can completely change direction very quickly, many people desire such changes, even when they may not be needed. Hiring relies on strongly on non-biased interviewing (the worst predictor of future performance). A desire to keep things &#039;fair&#039; means people hoping to work in Google can often get a poor experience. I don&#039;t like referring people to work here - even though I know they&#039;ll kick ass at the job, my opinion is deemed too subjective to be useful.</p> review3179: huge workload and the boos sometimes overlook empolyee&#039;s feeling</p> review3180: Company is growing bigger and bigger and getting problems of a big company - complicated and segmented processes preventing fast movement.</p> review3181: If you care about your professional relationships more than computing then go work somewhere else because many people you&#039;ll meet there are brainwashed beyond recovery and in the long run it&#039;s hard to put up with. Career opportunities are a myth.</p> review3182: Difficult to get in as it is very competitive.</p> review3183: the promotion system is truncated as the metrics used are not performance based, this is a shame for a company that promotes performance</p> review3184: career stagnation is a possibility no growth vertically</p> review3185: company is big, communication sucks</p> review3186: the company is becoming too big, and middle management is not as good as top</p> review3187: many fresh-out-of-college kids who think they know more than they do. geeks without any edge. little room for growth.</p> review3187: none thqt i can think of</p> review3188: there are almost no downsides, except that it is now a big company so there are a lot of processes and procedures that need to be followed at time, although management try really hard to make these as efficient and painless as possible</p> review3189: work life balance. they work you very hard</p> review3190: there is nothing negative at google. Just everybody is pretty smart</p> review3191: If you really want to have some downsides, there are 1) large company, the system is mature, you rarely have chance to play an important role in rebuilding the system; 2) hard to be promoted after senior, like a rest point</p> review3192: There are if you think but it&#039;s best (not one of) company to work for need to be competitive &amp; think ahead as there are best brains you are competing with.</p> review3193: lots of traffic to arrive</p> review3194: - Sometimes a bit chaotic.</p> review3195: everyday there is different problems to solve. need good skills on problem solving</p> review3196: Salary is sometimes not that competitive Promotion takes time as its a huge company now If you are in direct sales and you love interacting with clients on an every day basis then your job role will be quite interesting! In Online sales job responsibilities are not that exciting at times.</p> review3196: Some very pushy, self important individuals Getting more formal and corporate in outlook, particularly London office Very little informal game playing or fun etc, too competitive for people to take a break Will take up all your time if you let it Hires externally at the higher levels - a lot of unsatisfied people at the middle levels who will never rise any further Leaves you quite untrained / unqualified for roles outside the internet ads industry - unsupportive of recognized professional qualifications outside of MBAs</p> review3197: It isn&#039;t very organized or clean. There aren&#039;t very many bathrooms and the bathrooms they do have are always full or being used.</p> review3198: Large employee base Hard to standout and get promoted</p> review3199: -Middle management in the sales side of things needs a major revamp. Absolutely no regard for career development, work-life balance. Faulty and biased performance appraisal. Extremely non-Googley. The middle management lacks in people development skills and are too busy trying to push themselves up to bother about their reports. No recognition for rewards in the sales teams and as long as you are in the favored circle of the manager, your career is made. -While senior leadership in MV is extremely supportive of feedback, speak out to your local leaderhsip and you ring the death knell of your career at Google. -The sales side is turning into a nightmare with the sales HR in turn unable to turn things around or raise critical employee issues and thus resort to delivering lip service to employees. The senior leadership in MV needs to take a serious look into this.</p> review3200: Very difficult to work with all the geniuses around you...algorithms have to be on your fingertips...lots of competition</p> review3201: If you&#039;re not an engineer, there are much fewer career advancement opportunities. It is really easy to gain weight with all the delicious food.</p> review3202: Management is sometimes a little disconnected and the bi-coastal structure sometimes makes it hard to collaborate effectively and move forwards with projects.</p> review3203: none that are worth publicly complaining about</p> review3204: need to be more transparent</p> review3205: - Poor on boarding - In experienced work colleagues - Poor management - too many meetings</p> review3205: rudderless career management too many focus area constant re-org Can feel a little overwhelming at times. If you&#039;re someone that doesn&#039;t enjoy being a part of a large group or if you prefer working in very small, intimate teams, then Google may not be your best choice.</p> review3206: not many cons, they make it hard to leave work, huge place to work</p> review3207: too much time spent on work, sometimes too much time thinking of work even when you&#039;re out.</p> review3208: - Many engineers have little interest in or don&#039;t understand business issues. They&#039;d rather work on tough technical issues than solve real problems. Senior leadership doesn&#039;t seem to mind. - Many product managers are totally incompetent (especially those fresh out of school) and often do more harm than good. - Unless you work in PM or Eng, you are basically invisible. - Non-Eng/PM Google is not a meritocracy: Unless you are really good at marketing yourself, you will get promoted on the same timeline as everyone else (about once every two years), regardless of how good or bad your work is. However, masters of self-promotion can advance fast w/o accomplishing anything meaningful.</p> review3209: Work culture is very different from the US offices where you have a lot of flexibility in work. Bad work-life balance.</p> review3210: -Lack of quality managers -Little recognition</p> review3211: Can feel a little overwhelming at times. If you&#039;re someone that doesn&#039;t enjoy being a part of a large group or if you prefer working in very small, intimate teams, then Google may not be your best choice.</p> review3212: Middle order managers, not enough scope to move teams</p> review3213: Hectic, Schedule, lucrative salary, but slow</p> review3214: Too little order at Google.</p> review3214: rudderless career management too many focus area constant re-org</p> review3215: Long hours: It depends on the individual, but it&#039;s easy to feel that you need to produce more and ending up selling yourself short. The work involves a lot of time wasting &#034;archaeology&#034; - sifting through wikis, code labs and other people&#039;s code figuring out what is the latest recommended way to do something that sounds boiler-plate and obvious, so it&#039;s easy to feel unproductive at times. Also, the availability of free food, gym, etc. on campus and the plenty of fun distractions on its corp network make it easy to spend more time there. Hard to be visible and make an impact. Visibility and Impact are the economy by which software engineers are measured, and they are becoming harder to come by. I feel that most joining now are likely to end up being just a number: average (in Google standards) impact and zero visibility, irrespective of how much of a rock star they were in their previous jobs. It&#039;s becoming more and more the target of l awsuits, which basically means that legal fees will continue to cut a larger share of its revenues. In general, operating margins have been decreasing, although they are still amazing. I&#039;m not saying that legal fees are the reason for decreasing operating margins. Google is investing heavily (in new hires, acquisitions, etc) and any benefits from this spike in investment will take some time to catch up with the costs, and there is no guarantee that they ever will. I am a relatively recent (post-recession) hire, and after way over a year on the job I still feel that I am evaluating Google and wondering whether I can have a career here, which is not a good sign. Compared to previous jobs, I feel less recognized, having to work more, less proud of my work, and being more conscious on the effect that specific projects will have on my career instead of just doing what is right for the users/company. It is not that I am less smart/capable/experienced than others, it&#039;s ju st that the opportunities are less compared to someone who joined earlier. The work is not the most interesting I ever done, but it is OK and gives me the opportunity to expand my technical breadth. If this is all Google needs from me, then I am likely to move on, more sooner than later, and if this is a common experience of the relatively recent hires then the smartest and the brightest will not be flocking to Google anymore. Nothing particularly wrong with Google, I assume that&#039;s part of a company&#039;s normal progression from start-up to behemoth, and I still recommend giving Google a try, especially for new grads as it can be a good place to jump-start an engineering career. Just keep an eye on what you&#039;re getting out of your work and don&#039;t let the perks distract you from the bigger picture.</p> review3216: I believe there are None</p> review3217: None found in my experience</p> review3218: Well Google is attracting all the A level people so be ready to cpmpete harshly in order to get a promotion and a decent job.</p> review3219: The process of recruitment goes through various stages and can be very tedious and frustrating at times. They need to make it more clear.</p> review3220: too many ppl now. some of the teams move slowly. many star engineers leave the company already compensation is just ok for strong swes.</p> review3221: Large corporation so sometimes feel like just a number</p> review3222: The mountian view didn&#039;t give enough support to Google Beijing. The policy and culture of Google limit its growth in China.</p> review3223: Working on outside fun projects outside Google can be difficult due to the fact that the company&#039;s research interests are all over the map, causing things you do in your own time to potentially be subject to the company&#039;s copyright even if you never relied upon resources from work to accomplish them.</p> review3223: evaluation process management HR all about covering Google, not supporting employee</p> review3224: There are two moderately negative aspects of working at Google, one being that the work tends to become your life! You will often find yourself working until long after you were to have been off the clock, however this is normally due to the love of the job. Another nitpick is that when they&#039;re done with a position or location, options become very limited at an unfavorable rate if you aren&#039;t in a California site.</p> review3225: Too many overachievers and &#034;type A&#034; personalities all fighting for the next big thing. The company has grown so much that competition is greater thus limiting advancement. Lots of very junior and inexperienced managers who were great individual contributors that got promoted to be managers. Also not much support from upper management to grow.</p> review3226: Salary is lesser than what i want it to be. Even with recent salary hikes, i feel that working in remote offices is not beneficial.</p> review3227: Becoming a &#034;Big Corporation&#034;. Slow production speed.</p> review3228: entry level jobs lack responsibility but all in all a good place to work. Pay could be increased but great benefits make up.</p> review3229: location placement was not to my preference</p> review3230: - Middle Managament - A lot of smart people - It´s too big. - Few career advancement opportunities. - Too much stress full</p> review3231: Getting increasingly bureaucratic, regional teams are not empowered as much as the headquarters in terms of decision making, therefore roles at regional levels have limited in scope.</p> review3232: Lots of jobs on offer. Important to choose the right profile</p> review3232: Middle management is huge and intrusive.</p> review3233: I did not have many negative factors affect my work at Google. My pay was maybe as little lower than with other companies, but that&#039;s me maybe being greedy.</p> review3234: While at google I noticed that the company is becoming just like any other big company, it used to be ran like a university where people worked together and learned from each other.</p> review3235: Not much to say, very great environment</p> review3236: It is all about who is your manager, and as Google now loosing great people to facebook they are dont have as agreat people as they used to which creats so much politics that you cant believe.</p> review3237: very fast paced environment, loads of projects running simultaneously, product is develped very quickly, sometimes the field sales teams hear about a new feature in the field from a client.</p> review3238: tradeoffs with personal life, backstabbing for promotions</p> review3239: You end up working on some internal projects which might be very challenging but do not let you satisfy the startup spark in you</p> review3240: Employees are spoiled children, more concerned about whether they are getting cupcakes in the afternoon than with career development or receiving useful feedback. Middle managers in Sales are useless: no decision power, no direct business involvement. Promotions have ground to a halt at Google. Curve-based calibration of employees&#039; performance assures nobody is ever rewarded for good performance. Most new employees can expect &#034;Meet expectations&#039; feedback for at least a year. Low-performers are never punished and outlast good performers. Company is losing talent fast.</p> review3241: You begin to feel like a big fish in a small pond because there are so many people that work at this company. It is hard to do your own thing and make a big impact.</p> review3241: Non-competitive salaries depending on the department</p> review3242: A degree of management naiveté, restrictive hiring practices</p> review3243: The work is always not important enough.</p> review3244: Company policy, not that fun when you working, pressure, dead line, pushing, sometime you have to give up some life for the work</p> review3245: lot of beracracy in this env</p> review3246: Too large to actually accomplish significant things depending on your role.</p> review3247: The company is not very agile and it takes a lot to get features rolled out as soon as possible.</p> review3248: easy to feel lost, no work life balance, people are too cocky because they work there, no room for advancement</p> review3249: Under paid, over worked, hard to move up on the business side without an MBA</p> review3250: It is a big company and therefore, everybody does very detailed work and the work is just a little piece of the whole project. Learning things is slow than in a small company.</p> review3250: Not much guidance in terms of professional development, so the incentive is upon the individual to seek out mentors and guidance on his or her own.</p> review3251: My job here is definitely an intense commitment. My average work week is probably around 60 hours, and is occasionally longer still. That being said, nobody here is pressuring me to work this hard. Results get respect around here, though, so be prepared to achieve them one way or another.</p> review3252: Expected to work very hard (poor work/life balance).</p> review3253: At times the hours are very stressful</p> review3254: The feeling that the company is working on too many things.</p> review3255: Give engineers more capability to influence product development and product marketing. Middle management is really redundant. It seems that a lot of directors &#039; main function is to serve as costly email routers. Hope that Google can be lean again!</p> review3256: Google is already a big company, mature. If you join at this moment. you may not get too many stock options.</p> review3257: - Too many promoted for how they promote themselves not for what they do or add. - A focus on cutting the bottom 5% &#034;just because&#034; - Hiring at a level above the actual job requirements which means people are working below their capabilities. - Lots of lazy people who can do so because they have been there long enough -</p> review3258: handful of our middle managers, not enough recognition, poor feedback, job can be repetitive.</p> review3259: There&#039;s a very strong focus on visibility on a team. Sometimes you could find yourself doing something for the sake of visibility - not it&#039;s usefulness.</p> review3259: too intellectual community, peer pressure</p> review3260: Horrible work-life balance. People inside the company tend to say its up to one person to have a balance. However true, there&#039;s lots of pressure and workload and its tough to handle. After 3-4 years you don&#039;t learn anything new and the job is routine-like. The company is getting bigger and promotions are very hard to obtain, specially as most people in the company are top performers.</p> review3261: While well run, Google is still an enormous company. While bureaucracy is kept at a minimum, Google is definitely no longer what it used to be in terms of a startup-like environment.</p> review3262: As the size grows, policities start to kick in. There are people (thankfully, only a few) who talk the talk but not walk the walk that are fast-track in the promotion.</p> review3263: heavy work pressure. A lot of expectations from manager, peer, and subordinates.</p> review3264: Limited freedom. 20% time is nonsense because it is not implemented. Middle management is inefficient. This is getting worse as the organization is growing in size.</p> review3265: too much pressure need to work over time benefit is not as good as before cancel some projects since they are not promising</p> review3266: Sometimes it can take too long to be promoted or get where you want to go. Company is also turning more corporate away from the start up mentality. Very centralized decision making makes it difficult to get things done locally.</p> review3267: The intern-ship programme could be a bit more organised. Also it takes ages for Google HR to react to anything esp. the recruiting process takes too long.</p> review3268: At the end of the day it is a corporation, even on smaller projects there is red tape.</p> review3268: Google is very set in it&#039;s ways about a few things making it hard to do certain things which can be frustrating.</p> review3269: Google has very high expectations and hours.</p> review3270: There&#039;s a ton of folks trying to climb up the corporate ladder and you tend to get frustrated if you dont get promoted during the promotion cycle.</p> review3271: - Promotion system - Jerks tolerated by management - Work/life balance</p> review3272: Long work hours, poor middle management</p> review3273: Lack of structure and direction can cause stress. The freedom can work to your disadvantage. Constantly need to reinvent yourself.</p> review3274: If you work very hard but are not among the top 10% then it is very difficult for you to get promoted. It is getting more and more bureaucratic.</p> review3275: Too many managers from Microsoft who brought their own culture to the company. Too many mid level managers who have now more or less made the top management inaccessible</p> review3276: decision making process, promotions, internal mobility and availability of job positions in the US headquarter in Mountain View</p> review3277: The main negative that I noticed, which probably just simply depends on your goals is that although it&#039;s a positive to be at such a giant company, that can also serve to be difficult for advancement.</p> review3277: It was hard to keep up with the over achieving personalities and keep up with the fast pace of the new hires.</p> review3278: not sure what I should do each day. Just guess what I need to do I have to consider market</p> review3279: Severe caste system: be an engineer or be nobody, and there are ranks within engineering. Quarterly semi-secret stack-ranking system; goal of getting rid of the bottom 5% every year. (Sound like Microsoft? Yup.) Bi-annual self- and peer evaluations. In short, the promotion and evaluation process is exhausting, neverending, and notoriously unfair. If you work in a &#034;distributed office&#034; (outside Mountain View) prepare to be seriously out of the loop and to have limited access to the cool projects and the ones that can build your career. The company used to be just as adorable as its publicity. Now it is so big that it can&#039;t be. By this point (2010) Sergey and Larry are completely clueless about actual life at the company and the open-questions meetings consist of somebody asking a serious question, Sergey making a joke, and the question dangling unanswered. When you hear someone bring up a serious personnel problem, it&#039;s either too confidential to  discuss or it couldn&#039;t really have happened. The famous &#034;20% project&#034; where you get one day a week to work on projects you dream up yourself is openly admitted by senior executives to mean &#034;work you do on the weekend&#034;, not &#034;work you do on Friday&#034;. Do NOT depend on the legendary day-care program. Last I heard there was at least a year&#039;s waiting list. There used to be a three-year waiting list, but they solved that problem by raising the fees so high that most Googlers couldn&#039;t afford it. (Seriously. It was out-and-out explained that the oversubscribed daycare was an economic problem, and higher prices would resolve it.) Come to Google for technological challenge; come for brilliant co-workers. But don&#039;t come for a kinder, gentler software company; at this scale, there&#039;s no such thing.</p> review3280: The learning curve for a particular technology could be high since there are so many technologies are used here at Google.</p> review3281: Too many duplicate parallel products/efforts</p> review3282: High expectations of staff to self manage and self-motivate may be difficult for some. Feedback must be sought, rather than expected.</p> review3283: Google is the only company I&#039;ve ever worked for where I&#039;ve had to put up with an endless supply of childish and disrespectful behavior coming from coworkers. It&#039;s also the only workplace I&#039;ve been to where my manager behaves like a 12 year old. The amount of hypocrisy is appalling as well. You have people who have been brainwashed into the &#034;Googley&#034; way and then the hypocrites who piss on the company&#039;s core values while expecting the rest to be nice and googley all they long. Google prides itself in having a peer review system which means hard work is recognized and high performers get promoted. Really far from the truth, if your manager doesn&#039;t like you, for whatever reason, you will be left there to rot while other get promoted in front of you, no matter how high your performance review scores are.</p> review3284: Has employees from different counties and aspects. Also casual and frendly atmosphere in the company. Great food keeps energy up.</p> review3285: There are too many people working so sometimes you get lost The timiings aren&#039;t that great you have to be working alot</p> review3286: No direct access to other teams. Feels like working in a vacuum. Quit after 4 months.</p> review3286: Uncertain career progression and development. Promotion processes can be opaque. In the end this is still an engineering company. Next comes sales...and everyone else is expendable. 20% time only applies to engineers. Culture progressively changing to be more corporate. Not easy to move or rotate internally.</p> review3287: I was only there for a few months, so I did not really find any cons. Probably if any would be commute between buildings.</p> review3288: - it&#039;s hard to leave because it&#039;s very comfortable. - people are settled into current roles. - does not feel like a start up.</p> review3289: not as exciting as an active job. Even though you spend alot of time sitting on the job there isnt much to do on the computer instead of working.</p> review3290: as the company is scaling in a very large way, getting promoted is now a very long process and can be quite frustrating</p> review3291: An expectation that you will work all hours of the day - breakfast, lunch and dinner is provided for a reason. Not the best salary in the world, but everything else that&#039;s great about the place makes up for that. There&#039;s a bit of &#034;that&#039;s not out remit&#034; discussion between departments, which can lead to things not being picked up.</p> review3292: The company has become large and slowed down. Once you have a nice side project, it&#039;s challenging to get it to grow.</p> review3293: salary is medium, but benefits (free food, healtyhcare, bike plan) will counter that seems the growth and the opportunities are a little bit stretched</p> review3294: Company is slowly getting bloated in terms of # of people and pace. No longer is as agile and fast paced as it used to be.</p> review3295: Smaller office can be rife with cronyism and local management more concerned about their relationship with their superiors rather than their reports.</p> review3295: Extremely bureaucratic. As part of a sales force I spend less than 10% of time talking to clients, about 60% of time reporting, the rest is meetings. Slow decision making processes due to bureaucracy. Very poor middle management - middle management is just people who happened to join Google early and stayed. Unclear career paths. Reportomania. Micromanagement. Poor salary, even when perks are taken into consideration. Environment with many initiatives that only serve to increase internal visibility towards managers but does not create any real value. If you work here, make sure you understand how your work is measured and do not spend any time on anything else, even if those metrics are clearly hilarious. Leadership by spreadsheets and not by people skills.</p> review3296: Working in a highly competitive field means that you have to be on your toes all the time to stay ahead.</p> review3297: Pay If you can&#039;t participate in the culture, it&#039;s not as fun</p> review3298: Hiring process sucks. It is an elitist organization who only values GPA and not actual experience. Plus the process for process sake and thousands of spreadsheets is cumbersome. You spend more time updating and submitting reports rather than doing your job, just to justify why you are there. Management by data and metrics, if that is your thing, you will excel here. Otherwise, run to the nearest exit.</p> review3299: engineering-driven project development, limited career growth for non-eng; doesn&#039;t provide career development assistance, doesn&#039;t value experience much from other industry</p> review3300: highly innovative high competition sometimes stressfull</p> review3301: Sometimes difficult to get to another position.</p> review3302: Poor management by team leads and next few layers. Received conflicting instructions. Supervisor&#039;s and management are not willing to stand up for their people or rock the boat for what is right. Easier to say they will take care of something and not do it than to do it.</p> review3303: Not happy with current boss. No free drink anymore. Less benefit</p> review3304: there are little opportunities for growth perks are nice, but it&#039;d be better to be compensated as such work is not that interesting</p> review3304: the downside is that the work load at the google is very high and you should work hard to achieve the target.</p> review3305: Sometimes the management loses focus about the priorities and puts the wrong people forward for the wrong jobs. Having cool star trek names is not the only thing which makes a work place &#039;tick&#039;</p> review3306: maybe try take on more permanent roles instead of temps</p> review3307: Crowded office, it&#039;s not a startup any more - not easy to get promoted. Bureaucracy seems to be an issue.</p> review3308: 1. Nothing that you learn at google can be reused 2. Lot of sucking up. You get tired of it. 3. Peers are arrogant</p> review3309: Egos Fiefdom building Not flat Little to no headroom if you have neither a PhD nor an MBA from an ivy league school Salaries</p> review3310: - Organizations are slow to move. - Promotion policies are bizarre</p> review3311: It is becoming very corporate.</p> review3312: the company is going down the hill since 2008, and the compensation for the new employees is not impressive compared to competitors</p> review3313: - Controlled chaos is sometimes not controlled - No meaningful people management or development (looks like things are changing now) - Functions outside of eng and prod have considerably less influence</p> review3313: Unfortunately, the culture of the company has changed as the company has grown and it&#039;s obviously much harder for any given individual to make a significant impact. Furthermore, a lot of product decisions and strategies are still tightly controlled from the top, which is no longer scalable with an engineering force of more than 10,000. This leads to a large number of engineers working leisurely on products not essential to the core company strategy.</p> review3314: lots of work but limited upside as compared to starting a company</p> review3315: Google is a larger company now and it&#039;s a bit harder to make an impact than it was when Google was just a start up.</p> review3316: Large company comes with some politics and harder to make huge impact. Not much more in the cons area. Google is a great place to work.</p> review3317: Managers - Anyone who has worked at Google will agree that the managers are below par. I wouldn&#039;t admit is is true in all cases. However, the average manager at Google, just doesn&#039;t have the leadership skills required. Lack of transparency from mid management - While the top management is quite clear/transparent with it communications/plans, it is totally absent from mid-management. Again, the issue is with managers. Most managers are busy driving their personal agenda, and they often neglect others&#039; growth in the company. Promotion criteria is totally biased towards &#039;favourable employees&#039; being more favoured. Career prospects - Google isn&#039;t a place for long term career planning. After a point in time you are stuck, and your role leads you no where, and some of the operational-role based teams aren&#039;t sure about the direction of the team. Discussing this with your manager is of no help because the manger simply doesn&#039;t have t he time for such career enhancement talks. Overall, Google is headed towards being any other big organization with bureaucracy ranging from lunch table to promotions to reviews.</p> review3318: Things are moving slower. People are feeling the pressure of the economy. Bad balance between work and personal life.</p> review3319: -very low salary -low growth potential</p> review3320: Depending on what department you are in, your experience will vary a lot. In Online Sales and Operations, career paths are limited. Google tends to hire bright, young, over-qualified Ivy League grads into jobs that may not be the best use of their talent. Therefore, turnover is high, and many OSO positions are a good place to spend 2-3 years at most.</p> review3321: They only let you do this job for two years. Feedback was sometimes lacking or confusing.</p> review3322: - Immature or no leadership and middle management - subtly arrogant in some cases, very arrogant - extremely competitive so there&#039;s little trust among employees - non confrontational culture, so issues are not resolved - management means that they let issues get resolved or fought at the employees level or tucked under the rug - too much hype and not enough thought to what they do</p> review3322: very corporate as opposed what people think managers have little headroom to grow since its a flat org</p> review3323: Poor management, terrible and untrustworthy HR department, little to no advancement opportunities, low pay/salary structure compared to the marketplace.</p> review3324: Inexperienced management, cult-like internal &#039;droid&#039; type mentality amongst workers, limited career growth, beware: 99% of job descriptions posted by Google are VERY misleading, take Ivy league and top 25 graduates and place in generic customer satisfactions roles on phones, absurd work hours (60 hr per week), too many people believe the corporate spin - remember - Money &amp; other magazines give the top spot to whoever slips the most under the counter. Misleading motto: &#034;Don&#039;t Be Evil&#034;</p> review3325: project is too complex, do not have own time for the research. pay is not high compared to other companies.</p> review3326: + Flat org structure makes it hard to move into team lead roles + You have to promote yourself and your work well to get ahead + Not as entreprenuerial of a working environment as a few years ago; more process now</p> review3327: Work life balance was not always respected by management, plans would sometimes have to change with no warning. This was rare thought.</p> review3328: - at times consensus driven culture paralyzes teams and action - flat organization means little opportunities for career advancement promotion after a certain point -- there just aren&#039;t enough senior manager / head / director roles available</p> review3329: very busy life and you have to work long hours and therefore you will be lack of personal life and exercise</p> review3330: Google is rammed with absolutely top class people...which means it is very difficult to stand out, make promotion &amp; get the best projects. This can be frustrating to people who have come from smaller, less well-staffed companies (who are most likely used to being the big-star) as they can end up feeling unappreciated. Googlers are also a fairly arrogant bunch...which means that it can be difficult to lead, as everyone is convinced of their own rightness, and the overly democratic method of decision making means things can move more slowly than you would hope.</p> review3331: Sometimes it seems that the company loses sight of some of its activities, which results in duplication and scarce integration of efforts. Also, not everything is &#034;interesting cutting edge technological work&#034;, at Google: sometimes very smart people have to do very boring jobs, because the areas that bring the higher income are also the most established, less innovative and most &#034;traditional&#034;, in terms of what kind of work activities they need.</p> review3331: deadlines need to be hard working lacks training and tutoring political and incompetent management who are more interested in promoting their own agendas than working in the best interest of the company</p> review3332: - &#034;managed chaos&#034; is a joke, it is out of control - high tech company running on intensively manual or haphazard processes - constant change and restructuring of organizations driven by poor decisions - excessive meetings with no clear decisions or execution path, lack of single decision maker - laissez-faire attitude resulting in inconsistent and/or incoherent practices across the company - political and incompetent management who are more interested in promoting their own agendas than working in the best interest of the company</p> review3333: disorganized environment low pay poor management structure free for all</p> review3334: Political, political political. Promotions are not based on merit, rather based on who you suck up to. Not fun anymore.</p> review3335: - Bureaucracy (not sure if there is any company that escapes this) - Innovation (despite great products, there is a lot of scope to innovate) - Deadlines (not sure if my manager understands running fast makes you finish late)</p> review3336: Google is a very young company still, so not all of it&#039;s infrastructure seems to be in place just yet.</p> review3337: no fun and culture as compared to google in other countries no appreciation and encouragement less transperency than expected from google</p> review3338: - Not blabbing a lot about what you do means that you&#039;re not doing much. - Can be too competitive in some teams. - A lot of monkey business in Sales..</p> review3339: The downside of working at Google is getting lost among all the other brilliant people. The loudest and most talkative employees are the ones that get the most recognition. The people who complain the most get the most attention.</p> review3340: Neverending workload and hours, constant firedrill - change for change&#039;s sake, lack of recognition, very limited career opportunities for many (all of whom are used to being high achievers), highly political, company rests on its laurels regarding its reputation as a great employer</p> review3340: Google is now a very big company, and decisions involve a lot of people -- some times it&#039;s hard to get things done even if they seem simple.</p> review3341: Google definitely has a work-life balance problem. Also, some of the people had a very entitled and arrogant attitude, which was quite off-putting.</p> review3342: no work life balance support</p> review3343: No career advancement, no insight into how your individual work ties into higher level strategy, lack of professionalism, strategic and organizational changes are executed slowly and ineffectively.</p> review3344: - sometimes long hours - too many projects going on at once - too much emphasis on GPA&#039;s</p> review3345: -No room for growth. -If you are a contractor and didn&#039;t go to a top tier school, you will not become permanent. -GPA is more important than job performance for movement within. -Work isn&#039;t challenging as you are just another person sitting behind a computer.</p> review3346: Too Many meetings too much paper work</p> review3347: Expectations are high. Expect to work a lot of hours</p> review3348: -Low compensation for the lower positions -Limited promotion opportunities -Most people here are over qualified for the type of work they do, resulting in lack of challenge. -Becoming increasingly bureaucratic as it grows, which means more budget approvals and red tape. -Hard to diffirentiate yourself amongst all the smart people, making it harder to advance. -The lower pay in Google is supposed to be balanced out by all the &#039;perks&#039; provided to you in the office, however unless you think that someone else knows better your consumption habits, you would probably want to have the cash instead!</p> review3349: For my first week, I was given the task of working in the &#034;AdWords Approval Bin&#034; - a place where all automatically disapproved ads are kept and individually screened by Google employees. Many interns were given this for a week or two. Some people apparently spent half their internship doing it. Its not challenging nor stimulating - its very repetitive. Although they do give interns big projects, from my experience very few of the projects (especially if they are focused on AdWords) will be implemented. This is due to the fact that most changes to AdWords are typically incremental and only seem to tweak what has already proved itself to be a very succesful product.</p> review3349: Most managers are jokes and if you are not their pet employee will barely know you exist. This mean that on quarterly and annual review your manager will inflate the work done by his favorite employees and strongly back their deserving for a bonus, promotion etc, while having little to say to the committees about the value of your work. If promotions are rare and reserved for a select few, raises are almost non-existent and far below inflation. 20% time mean you have to sleep less and work more during the week and forget about weekends. The running joke is that 20% percent means you work 20% more time than the current 140% time you spend on a fictional 40h work week. Taking vacation lower your performance ratings resulting in lower bonus and less chance for a promotion or raise. Same goes for sick days, parental leave, or even for being unreachable on a weekend (while not on call). Some of my coworkers had to complain to HR about their managers and got little supp ort. HR would not recognize any wrongdoing and downplay issues as personality mismatch and misunderstandings. I&#039;ve witnessed situations unblock with HR only after a VP was contacted for help by the employee.</p> review3350: Too Mountain View centric. Most key persons are in HQ and most important decisions are made there. It&#039;s a pain for offices to collaborate across timezones. For example, it&#039;s impossible for JAPAC, EMEA, and the US to meet together.</p> review3351: It really depends on what department you&#039;re in. Often times, you can feel like just a number, even though Google really prides themselves on having a start up culture. Google is a large corporation, and that is starting to show more and more due to the economy.</p> review3352: However, unless you are careful, you might find yourself digging a hole with no way out. It is no longer as easy to climb as it used to be within the organisation.</p> review3353: Nothing is wrong with google.</p> review3354: Long hours sometimes, not being able to talk about what you are working on outside the company</p> review3355: Google has become very hierarchical, political, and bureaucratic. Over the years, management has distanced itself from its employees and become more and more arrogant. Sales &#034;all hands&#034; meetings have become occasions for management to indulge in self-congratulatory ramblings, pats on the back and vague replies to serious questions. With the recent departure of many key individuals at the company, morale and the famous &#034;googley&#034; culture are suffering. It is very difficult to be heard, make an impact or receive recognition for successful work. Creativity and risk-taking are now discouraged as evidenced by the recent closure of several teams who were not bringing in enough revenue. The unfortunate aspect of this new environment is that many talented Googlers were encouraged to join innovative teams but suddenly found themselves scrambling for jobs when the company&#039;s strategy changed yet again. Google&#039;s profits are heavily scrutinized and  the new sales leadership puts perhaps too much pressure on employees to bring in immediate sales rather than think long-term. This reality conflicts with senior management&#039;s statements about career advancement, constant learning and risk-taking and their desire to position Google as a multimedia advertising solution. These factors partially demonstrate the disconnect between senior management&#039;s claims and sales management&#039;s actions. If you are patient for promotions (it sometimes takes years), don&#039;t mind a confusing and constantly changing org structure, can tolerate impersonal upper management and incompetent middle managers (although some of them are outstanding), and finally, are willing to set aside aspirations to innovate, Google is not a bad place to work.</p> review3356: too busy and too many meetings</p> review3357: There were two major downsides of doing temp work from home for Google. One was the astonishing lack of communication. This shifted a little while I was working there; they began developing a sort of report card system so that we could see how our rating work scored compared to previous months and how we were doing overall. But while I was there, that system only worked for a small fraction of the projects I was working on, so it wasn&#039;t particularly helpful. More to the point, there was no positive feedback given to anyone at all, and communication between employees seemed to be discouraged - two classic characteristics of a dysfunctional work environment. Occasionally if a rating was very far off of what they were looking for - usually due to a typo or misclick - they would send it back with a warning saying so, but that represented the sum total of feedback given. Personally, I found it very difficult to work with no input about whether they wished I were g oing faster, whether I was going faster than my peers, whether I was doing a great job, or - most of all - any input about how to improve in general. Sure, it&#039;s a year-long temp job, but one which can potentially be repeated after another year has passed - and besides, who doesn&#039;t want to receive positive feedback and learn how to improve and receive more? I guess more importantly, who doesn&#039;t want to know what the expectations for their work are?? The one saving grace for me was that I found a forum for people working from home where some other folks who were doing temp work for Google could get together and chat a little - without breaking any confidentiality agreements - about what we struggled with, how much we were able to do in a day, and what we thought the expectations for us were, based on all of our experiences. The other major downside was that the temp agency they used, WorkForceLogic, was just TERRIBLE - specifically at handling payroll, which is  a terrible thing to be terrible at. There were many times that I didn&#039;t get paid, got a bonus deducted from my check instead of added to it, et cetera - and it was always a different mistake from all the ones they had made before, and it always took them a while to figure out what had gone wrong, track down whoever needed to fix it, wait for them to get back from lunch or an appointment or come back to work the next day or.... And they were no better at communication, really; I had hoped that once this assignment was up I would be able to get more assignments through WFL, but no matter how many phone calls I made, nobody could ever figure out who I should be talking to or find anyone who would return calls.</p> review3358: A few years ago during the internet boom we all received fat raises so our salaries would keep pace with the booming silicon valley. Well, those days are over, and look how well most of those start-ups with their extravagant compensation packages did. You want a fatter paycheck? Create some revolutionary product that raises profits: your paycheck is tied to Google&#039;s bottom line. A long time ago people came to Google because they wanted to work for a company that was changing the world, not because Google offered the fattest paycheck. Google compensates well, but if what you&#039;re looking for is a new Porsche every year then look somewhere else. I want to work with people who are excited to work on great software, not those who are obsessed with counting pennies.</p> review3358: getting increasingly political, some benefits are getting cut off</p> review3359: It feels like it&#039;s tending to become more bureaucratic. Nothing like on the scale of my last job, but still not what I expected when I joined. &#034;Gut feel&#034; and intuition are far outweighed by numbers. That&#039;s not necessarily a downside, but it does mean you are restricted to only making certain kinds of arguments if you wish your recommendations to be taken seriously, and this style doesn&#039;t necessarily suit everyone.</p> review3360: There is no clear career progression, and management is arrogant.</p> review3361: Advancement is difficult, as there are a lot of talented people competing for a relatively small number of promotion slots.</p> review3362: Your job is generally dreadfully boring, so the good perks are the only thing you can really look for to. Once these are taken away I&#039;m not really sure why someone would want to work there, usually perhaps you are an engineer. There is no real career growth at Google, because no one wants to leave, this forces the best talent to leave the firm prematurely while the good old boys keep their well paid jobs.</p> review3363: The perks are pretty good. But the salary is way below par. You could earn twice as much working in the financial services sector for the same hours. The rationale that you are working for Google so you should be happy with your salary is bogus.</p> review3364: A little chaos. I only joined this comany for months, so no more opionions.</p> review3365: non engineers are treated differently, it is slowly becoming a rigid organization, so getting a promotion becomes difficult (depends on your department and how old it is).</p> review3366: As the organisation grows, the &#039;flatness&#039; of it makes it pretty exhausting: there are too many other people and functions to deal with, and very little opportunity to delegate responsibility. A corollary of is that you&#039;re valued and recognised in proportion to how you&#039;re viewed by those many other people, which favours those who&#039;re noisiest. Self-promotion and internal marketing for yourself and your projects is (usually) something you need to take time over if you&#039;re going to do well here, and that&#039;s a pity because it&#039;s mostly unproductive - in the sense that the company or the projects don&#039;t improve much for you shouting about them.</p> review3367: You&#039;re given the opportunity to work on your own ideas, but you often find that someone else is working on exactly the same thing. It&#039;s hard to find an interesting piece of work that you can call your own. Also projects are getting more and more siloed into the different offices, so you will only be able to work on specific projects.</p> review3367: As it has grown big, Google has become miserably stagnant when it comes to giving proper recognition to employees, during perf-cycles and promotion. They manage to suck the top brains from fresh college grads (from IITs, IISc) at a low package and yet quoting an attractive package which differs from CTC by at least 12000$ (yearly). Needless to say, these include the cost of &#034;perks&#034; shown at a exaggerated rate and some components which are never realized. Whereas in off-campus recruitment they make reasonably good offer (often more than double, triple the amount offered to college hires of same level) to get a candidate, even if it maybe for test-engineer position. Work is often monotonous, and rarely helps to your career growth. Even after working for years on so-called &#034;cool&#034; products, but that hardly sells outside google. And if you think you&#039;re going to spend your entire career in Google until retirement, it&#039;s going to be a sure-sh ot peril to your technical career. So, ret rid of the pride of working in the &#034;best company&#034; and look for a better career for yourself.</p> review3368: Where do I start? If you have completed more than 5 years work in your career, don&#039;t even consider joining this glorified telesales centre. It is mind-numbing work, filled with smart people bored out of their heads and quitely killing time to get the 2 year stint onto their CV. The place is full of politics. My line manager did not address me for more than one sentence at a time for the first FOUR MONTHS I worked there there. It simply was not going to bring her any benefit or kudos to be seen fraternising with an inferior. The arrogance of the place is pretty astounding too. &#039;You should be honoured to be working there&#039;. My peers were great people, but it&#039;s the kind of place you have to be sure you are going to fit in, because if you don&#039;t (in my team about 20% of us) you will not last more than a year before slowly losing the will to live. If fussball, free food and a great social life is high on your agenda, go for it. If self-developmen t, career progression, nurturing and supportive environment and understanding management are important to you, look elsewhere</p> review3369: Limited opportunities for advancement, arbitrary compensation system, lack for feedback/professional development.</p> review3370: Google needs to do a much better of matching the skillset of employee and the role being offered.The</p> review3371: Some of the drawbacks of the this compny is that the management is very unorganized out there. They are very mechanical in their approach and miss out on the personal touch. With the changing ways and methodologies of various operations of the company, I&#039;m facing great problems to cope up with and carry on with my work like I used to do previously.</p> review3372: Work life balance. You have to force yourself to take advantages of the perks. If your position requires you to constantly travel you may never get to enjoy these perks. On top of this, Google expects you to extend them a credit line of up to 2x your monthly salary sometimes while traveling. They take their sweet time to reimburse you.</p> review3373: They don&#039;t suffer fools. If you move into an area that is not your strength, you can be penalised - a move from engineering to project management might take someone six months to get up to speed. In that time, they may be given only &#034;adequate&#034; performance reviews. All companies have &#039;dull jobs&#039; that are hard to automate. Google only hire &#039;best and brightest&#039;, which means some people can be really bored.</p> review3374: You will not have any career opportunities within the company. The task for the new graduates are pretty boring on the long term. It is almost impossible to move from an office to another, so don&#039;t expect to come back to your country if you are an expatriate. You will only meet graduates from the best schools because Google only hire in some colleges, no real background diversity.</p> review3375: too yuang company need too speed up for business growth</p> review3376: The company is growing rapidly and sometimes it is hard to stand out in the crowd. A lot of the technology is grown in house so while you may be able to enhance your general skills, you can&#039;t put &#039;X&#039; on your resume as Google doesn&#039;t use it while everyone else does. Individual experience and satisfaction varies greatly by department and manager.</p> review3376: There is no clear career progression, and senior management is arrogant.</p> review3377: Stress, crazy, trouble, noisy, zabzarab auf da trab. Oder wattt jeht alter? Nicht wahr...du bist mein Favorit oder net. Sowieso ne</p> review3378: Moeilijk een baan te krijgen.

Im Sales sehr viele extrem eingebildete Persönlichkeiten, da jeder eine sehr gute Ausbildung vorher genossen hat, zig Sprachen spricht, im Ausland war und am besten noch Jugend forscht oder im Olympiateam gewonnen hat (überspitzt).
