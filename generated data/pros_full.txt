review1: * If you&#039;re a software engineer, you&#039;re among the kings of the hill at Google. It&#039;s an engineer-driven company without a doubt (that *is* changing, but it&#039;s still very engineer-focused). * The perks are amazing. Yes, free breakfast, lunch, an dinner every weekday. Aaaaaamazing holiday parties (at Waldorf Astoria, NY Public Library, MoMA, etc.); overnight ski trips to Vermont; overnight nature trips to the Poconos in the summer; summer picnics at Chelsea piers; and on and on and on. I don&#039;t see this going away unless the company starts hurting financially. * Speaking of which, the company is doing quite well, which reflects in bonuses and equity grants. * There a huge diversity of work ranging from defending independent journalism worldwide (Google Project Shield) to crisis response during disasters (see Maps during Hurricane Sandy or Tsunamis), to the best machine learning experts and projects in the world, to more mundane revenue-driving pro jects in advertising, there&#039;s really something for everybody. * It&#039;s easy to move around within the company as long as you&#039;re in good standing (the vast majority of engineers are). * The company is amazingly open: every week Larry Page and Sergey Brin host what&#039;s called TGIF where food, beer, wine, etc. is served, a new project is presented, and afterward there&#039;s an open forum to ask the executives anything you want. It&#039;s truly fair game to ask anything, no matter how controversial, and frequently the executives will be responsive. * No, nobody cares if you use an iPhone, Facebook, shop with Amazon, stream using Spotify, or refuse to use Google+. The company is amazingly open and flexible. Neither pro nor con, but general information on work-life balance, promotions, and advancement. * Work life balance can be what you want it to be on most teams. (Some teams are in more competitive sectors and require more crazy hours all the time - but very fe w of them). If you do what&#039;s expected, you&#039;ll be fine at least for a handful of years. Working a roughly 40 hour work week is possible, and many people do it. There are also people who are hyper-motived and work like crazy just because they love it, or because they&#039;re competitive, or they want to get a promotion. If you work 40 hour weeks without putting in anything extra, you&#039;ll fall behind them as they advance and you stand still - and maybe that doesn&#039;t matter, so it works out for everybody. But at least know where you would realistically stand. * If you excel and work your butt off, you&#039;ll be compensated and promoted. If you let yourself be a code monkey, and just sit coding with your head down all day, you&#039;ll be fine but won&#039;t advance. A big complaint from some Googlers is about not being able to advance &#034;even at Google&#034; with pure coding. Sure, if you&#039;re the uber genius who created MapReduce and Bigtable, you&#039;r e going to advance like a rocket without having to do anything but coding; but if you&#039;re like most engineers at Google -- smarter than average, but just average compared to other Googlers -- you&#039;re just a good coder and not revolutionary. Code monkeys are important to actually get stuff done, and to be sure you absolutely need to be a good coder as a software engineer (it&#039;s the minimum requirement), but code monkeys won&#039;t advance because they&#039;re not leaders and they&#039;re easy to replace. To get promoted you need to lead and do more than just code. There are plenty of ways to lead other than being an official tech lead, so this isn&#039;t actually _that_ hard, so the real point is just that you can&#039;t just sit there coding what other people tell you to code all day and expect to advance.</p> review2: 1) Food, food, food. 15+ cafes on main campus (MTV) alone. Mini-kitchens, snacks, drinks, free breakfast/lunch/dinner, all day, errr&#039;day. 2) Benefits/perks. Free 24:7 gym access (on MTV campus). Free (self service) laundry (washer/dryer) available. Bowling alley. Volley ball pit. Custom-built and exclusive employee use only outdoor sport park (MTV). Free health/fitness assessments. Dog-friendly. Etc. etc. etc. 3) Compensation. In ~2010 or 2011, Google updated its compensation packages so that they were more competitive. 4) For the size of the organization (30K+), it has remained relatively innovative, nimble, and fast-paced and open with communication but, that is definitely changing (for the worse). 5) With so many departments, focus areas, and products, *in theory*, you should have plenty of opportunity to grow your career (horizontally or vertically). In practice, not true. 6) You get to work with some of the brightest, most innovative and hard-working/dilige nt minds in the industry. There&#039;s a &#034;con&#034; to that, too (see below).</p> review3: You can&#039;t find a more well-regarded company that actually deserves the hype it gets. You&#039;ll work on cutting edge projects / solve important issues that impact your community and the world You&#039;ll meet interesting people who are your colleagues, managers, and senior management. You&#039;ll open the paper and see your company in the news almost every day, and read about projects you&#039;re working on, which is a cool thing You&#039;ll see Larry and Sergey at TGIF and you&#039;ll admire how they lead the company. They are brilliant, goofy, low key but intense, and likeable. There are 22 cafes (more or less), the food is excellent, and it&#039;s free. Your pay will typically be competitive, though it needs to be tweaked up a bit since the economy has improved. Google cares about how it treats its employees. The campus is like an academic campus in many ways. There are tons of activities on campus, like authors speaking about their books, films after work,  and gyms where you can work out - but you&#039;ll need to make sure to carve out time to do these things. You&#039;ll get plenty of external validation from people who suddenly think you&#039;re smart and rich because you work there, even if you&#039;re not rich and you&#039;re as smart when you didn&#039;t work at Google. If and when you leave, you&#039;ll never regret having that company on your resume. It opens doors. The company is flexible - if you&#039;re lucky, you won&#039;t have a micromanager boss and you can be somewhat flexible in how you work - but don&#039;t get me wrong - you&#039;ll work a LOT. But you don&#039;t have to do all of it chained to your desk.</p> review4: I&#039;ve gone from a new grade hire to the tech lead of a 8 person team in 2 1/2 years, and I&#039;ve learned a ton along the way. Not every engineer you&#039;ll work with is amazing, some are just good, and a few are mediocre. However, so many are amazing that it&#039;s an absolute pleasure to work on the same codebase as they do. And the top people are actually quite accessible - I&#039;ve had questions I&#039;ve sent to mailing lists get answered by the authors of the Java memory model, the Android framework, and BoringSSL.</p> review5: Great culture, it&#039;s up to you to make your impact, amazing technology, treat us like adults, food&#039;s awesome, total comp is really great (current stock price really helps!)</p> review6: Lots of mobility, opportunities to be creative and take the lead.</p> review7: Great culture. Company really puts employee first.</p> review8: Helps with homework nice app and site helps with getting to know new information very useful I use it daily excellent app every one should get on Google to search info or look for a word description or if you want to learn a new language</p> review9: Great people, lots of perks, awesome benefits, global scope.</p> review10: Great place to work at.

Granted, being a large company, its ideals aren&#039;t always met, but the the culture of the company is to constantly strive to meet them. Among all the current large companies in the world, the culture is vastly superior. They are also one of the highest payers in the field when comparing total compensation. Of course, the facilities are pretty legendary.</p> review26: Culture of innovation, appreciation for strong performance, high value placed on quality managers.</p> review27: Free food, nice environment, decent salary, good company reputation, and a lot more great things.</p> review28: Great work Envirnoment and friendly staff.</p> review28: Free food, good infrastructure, mostly great people, mission, if you can get into a team that actually has a mission. Good pay, though no longer the best. Engineers still (mostly) run things there. It&#039;s easy to switch projects if you perform well and opportunities are actually available (which is not a given, especially in remote offices). It also feels like the company actually gives a damn about making the front line grunt feel good about working for Google. As the company is growing, culture is eroding slower than I thought it would.</p> review29: Opportunity to grow, training and integrity, people will feel good about themselg</p> review30: (1) Countless perks that probably adds 20% to your base salary (including free food, transportation, gym, dance/sports classes, etc) (2) Working with smart/Googley people (you can easily schedule one-to-one meetings with Googlers that are willing to teach a certain topic) (3) Working for a company that cares about its employees</p> review31: Free meals; Easy going, laid back work environment.</p> review32: The best part of the job is when you just talk with your mates and have fun because thats what it is all about.</p> review33: Great Company. The food is amazing. The people are brilliant, and the passion is palpable!</p> review34: Great benefits and friendly people. Never had a terrible day here.</p> review35: Lots of potential for learning on exciting projects</p> review36: I am a people person, that I love to meet different people that makes your work environment goes really smooth.</p> review37: Strong culture, lots of really smart people from whom you can learn a lot. Great resources, every aspect of company is innovative and doesn&#039;t settle for OK. Fun environment.</p> review37: 1. Good procedure 2. Everyone is nice 3. The interviewers are really friendly 4. Flight is very flexible</p> review38: Work with really smart, driven people. Product development and managers were top notch. I was able to move around to different teams and global offices every few years -- awesome!</p> review39: free snacks Things to do interesting projects would work there again for sure</p> review40: Good money, good people, good food. Everyone I&#039;ve worked with at Google has been a pleasure to work with.</p> review41: You can take it easy.</p> review42: good food and coffee free</p> review43: Great benefits, opportunity to work with smart individuals. NYC building is gorgeous.</p> review44: very fun place to work, lots of smart people</p> review45: Relaxed atmosphere means you aren&#039;t having your back watched. Folks can inflate their performance if they want and don&#039;t have to work too hard. Probably put in realistically about 30 hours per week of real work. Great benefits including free meals, free barista, free juice bar, free on-site gym with trainers, lots of events including on-site presenters. Local and Global perks including discounts on EVERYTHING much like AAA does for their customers. You get 20% off Sonos, Nest and just about any brand out there.</p> review46: it&#039;s generous to engineers, and more</p> review46: It&#039;s Google. You work with smart people, work on interesting projects, and have fantastic perks. Work life balance was surprisingly good.</p> review47: Imagine a place that you are working with the 20% people all the time, this is how it is working in Google. You can trust your co-working to get their part done almost 90+% of the time without nagging them.</p> review48: Great benefits and work-life balance, smart people and interesting products</p> review49: The work is interesting, and not tedious or boring. The expectations are not unreasonable. There is room to grow, ands expand ones skill set using the 20% time. Coworkers are amazing and one learns a lot. Perks are pretty awesome</p> review50: work with smart people laid back environment learned a lot.</p> review51: Culture, People, Experience, Mobility, Pace</p> review52: Fun greatly appreciated and then we can get back to do king size is not sure</p> review53: Goog knowledge of electrical feed for telecomunications</p> review54: loved everything about it. was a fun place to work</p> review55: Smart people Tons of interesting projects Lots of new cool things to learn and contribute Other perks such as free food, massages etc</p> review55: Google provides an opportunity to work with super smart, engaged people on exciting, fast-moving projects that have a huge impact.

A lot of the people think Google is all about lava lamps, free food, big pay checks. If Google removes all of it, Google will still be Google</p> review72: great great pay and benefits</p> review73: Bright and engaging people, amazing financial and non-financial benefits, healthy work life balance. Easily the biggest advantage of working at Google is the people; extremely intelligent, team oriented, and genuine.</p> review73: Best reasons to work at Google are being challenged by smart, creative people every day</p> review74: Great work conditions and good atmosphere also really nice benefits. Also the work space is really nice and love the free food</p> review75: Lots of autonomy, fun place to work, talented co-workers</p> review76: Great to stay in google with open atmosphere</p> review77: Great benefits and international career opps.

You can get fair pay comparing with other companies.</p> review84: Wonderful mission from the founders and leaders, which truly trickle down to every aspect of the company. Employees feel connected and included in the amazing contributions made from the entire Google workforce. You can tell that the founders truly do have idealistic notions that permeate the culture and create an atmosphere that is difficult to find and authentically recreate.</p> review85: Google has great coworkers, top-notch hardware and software infrastructure, excellent total compensation, lots of autonomy for workers, and excellent managers.</p> review86: - Velocity - Tackle solid technical problems</p> review87: Free food, great campus, great space, great people, unlimited resources, always something to do</p> review88: cool, smart people, pretty laid back, lots of the perks of being a google employee (e.g. games, lots of free food, etc)</p> review89: Loved the people when I started, loved the perks, loved the flexibility and trust in employees.

We enjoy excellent benefits, and the over-all compensation packages are terrific. It is possible to achieve a healthy work-life balance.</p> review111: Great teams, great products, great environment. Highly recommended.</p> review112: Work at google to get free food</p> review113: Great benefits; Free Food; Smart Coworkers; Impactful Projects</p> review114: Tales of terrible work-life balance are exaggerated, tales of lavish benefits are not. 9-5 or 10-6 are pretty standard working hours, although some choose to work longer. Managers are explicitly there to help you get ahead in your career - most take that to heart and act accordingly. Strong culture of engineering well, rather than fast. Unit testing, code coverage, automated sanity checks, peer reviews, etc are the norm. VERY socially responsible company, even more than they like to advertise. It&#039;s easy to feel proud to work for a company acting very intentionally to do great things for the world.</p> review115: Amazing benefits, especially insurance and maternity leave</p> review116: Had a lot of fun at this job. Was really cool to be working for google. Would recomend.</p> review117: Your work gets a lot of exposure.</p> review118: Living the Google life.

Transparency from the very top down. Opportunities to work with brilliant minds.</p> review121: All the benefits are amazing.</p> review122: Free food, great benefits, flexible work environment.</p> review123: Google is perhaps the best big corporation you can work for which is well known so I don&#039;t have to write much here.</p> review124: very smart people, fascinating innovation, amazing perks</p> review125: Great work life balance, amazing perks, smart and ambitious co-workers. Great lateral mobility opportunities at the company. Food is amazing too.</p> review126: Nothing to add here unfortunately</p> review127: -99% of the people you work with are brilliant, but are also not jerks -perks are amazing -food is great -work/life balance *can* be good, depending on what team you&#039;re on, who your manager is, etc.</p> review127: culture, products, impact, people, fun</p> review128: Great company culture and benefits</p> review129: Great place to work at</p> review130: Intellectual environment, fast paced and ambitious.</p> review131: Brilliant people organizing information.

But the true secret to Google&#039;s success is a management philosophy of hiring the best people and trusting them to do their own work without top down hierarchical direction.</p> review185: * Google has, bar none, some of the best office schemes I&#039;ve ever seen. Their conference room layouts make a lot of sense, and the designs and liveliness pouring through those walls were on another level. * There are tons and tons AND TONS of teams at Google working on close to anything that you can think of, technical or not, and transferring between them is actually encouraged as long as you&#039;re on good standing performance-wise. * Feedback is taken very seriously at Google. It&#039;s paramount to their culture and it shows: the Food department cares a lot about turning out high-quality food, People Ops does everything they can to make the employee experience a happy one, etc. Even though it&#039;s kind-of a talking piece now, the TGIF sessions with Larry, Sergey and top management are unprecedented. * The food is quite good most of the time. Some of it&#039;s restaurant-quality, even. (It highly depends on the cafe you go to and the food you typically e at.) * Aside from a tech startup, I can&#039;t think of any other place that&#039;s on the bleeding edge of technology at this scale. Google is highly, highly experimental, almost to a fault. (More on that in the &#034;Cons.&#034;) * Their benefits are really generous for a large org. They&#039;re not insanely so compared to others like them, but all of the basics (and then some!) are covered. * If you like free stuff, Google will bury you with it over time. I didn&#039;t work there very long but somehow got two backpacks, a few shirts and a hoodie. Interns get way more stuff, though.</p> review186: Very smart people and flexibility to choose your projects, to choose your research areas.

The job was easy but ontologically harrowing.</p> review752: Huge career growth potential and just a downright fun place to work.</p> review753: Well, you might say that it&#039;s the on-site perks that are great, but really it&#039;s all an illusion because this company operates like the Borg and expects everyone to come in, conform, and become appendages to each other and the company as a whole. Also, having free food at work is nice, if only they offered heart-healthy, diabetic-friendly options. Too bad the campus isn&#039;t in a better location -- like a downtown San Francisco one where you at least had other options within walking distance. You can take the shuttle to work, true, but that keeps you trapped in a confined space for a long period of time with other Googlers. Not a pleasant experience.</p> review754: Recognition among family and friends Free bus service to the city</p> review755: Take away everything else, and the reason to work at Google is the people. I&#039;ve learned more here than I have anywhere else, and everyone I&#039;ve worked with has been mutually interested in improving each other. Being able to attend engineering talks by people all over the organization (and world) is a hugely enriching experience. Beyond that, all the perks are great: - Opportunity to make changes that affect huge numbers of users - Employees are judged by their contributions: nobody cares when you&#039;re in the office. It&#039;s very easy to set your own work life balance. Management knows that happy well-balanced workers are the most productive ones. - Incredible build environment: there&#039;s a huge amount of power at a developer&#039;s fingertips. Reviewing, testing, and code health are taken seriously. - Fascinating infrastructure: the internal environment is very open, and it&#039;s thrilling to be able to poke around and see how the Google machine t icks. - Leadership keeps us in the loop: we may not always like what they have to say, but we get weekly opportunities to ask upper management questions. - Tons of delicious food and snacks with huge variety: I&#039;ve started eating five small meals on workdays instead of three big ones. - Ability to job hunt internally: if you get tired of doing what you&#039;re doing, you can do a mini job application to start with a new team. - Medical benefits: I&#039;m continually surprised at what&#039;s covered with just a $15 copay. - Parties: Halloween and Christmas mean big fun elaborate parties, and there are lower key events like stargazing parties too. - Transportation: don&#039;t get me wrong, bay area traffic sucks, but being able to take a shuttle instead of driving gives me a good opportunity to get reading done without having to worry about transfers or other public transit snags. - Stock awards with value: sure, I missed the high risk high reward boat on this, but I proba bly would have bought Google stock even if I never worked here. - One hell of a rubber stamp for my resume in my eventual future job finding endeavors.</p> review756: Great environment and great people to work with.</p> review757: I worked at google for about 4 years now.

Great office decoration. Very nice to show off to your friends about the working environment. 2. Decent compensation. 3.

Still relevant development technologies, useful to future software jobs.</p> review761: best place in the world to work</p> review762: Amazing perks and compensation Opportunity to work with incredibly smart people Work on cool, strategic problems that can be really outlandish and experimental See across all levels of the organization</p> review763: Definitely the most amazing company on the Earth</p> review764: The vision of the company is genuine. Your family and friends love that you work there. The benefits are unparalleled.</p> review765: The food, the fun, the people - the culture is great.

Lots of opportunity to make an impact.</p> review772: Very good, competive, a lot of activities</p> review773: Free food, free bus ride, it&#039;s the chocolate factory and it&#039;s everything you&#039;ve heard.</p> review774: Great environment for innovation - you&#039;ll have the freedom to build on your ideas and even create your own job</p> review775: There is a huge variety of technology to build and utilize. Some roles require spinning up jobs across a huge number of machines where others are similarly challenging by targeting a wide variety of client hardware.</p> review775: Great benefits, easygoing staff, easy to change projects</p> review776: flexible work schedule hard problems smart people great perks/money</p> review777: Great company great benefits. Work/life balance totally depends on the team - some are great some are terrible.</p> review778: Smartest people to work with</p> review779: Free food, wonderful amenities, quick environment</p> review780: Working in a different environment, with multi levels of executives. Interesting and very challenging. Something new every day.</p> review781: There isn&#039;t much to say here...I mean the world is becoming more digital and google is on the rise...their expansions are ridiculous. They should loosen up though at times</p> review782: Very kind people, managers concerned with your overall well-being</p> review783: Amazingly talented people work at Google. They&#039;re eager, smart and willing to help. There are amazing ideas that float around and resources to make those things happen.</p> review784: - work/life balance - charitable giving and matching - most people you work with - extremely intelligent and fun to work with - benefits and perks - organizations mission and values</p> review784: - fun work that impacts millions of people and is helping to change the world - always learning and growing, peers are brilliant and help you grow - great compensation - great food - flexible work hours - a surprising amount of transparency from &#039;the top&#039;</p> review785: benefits (although shrinking), perks, flexibility to work from different offices, and cache of working a large tech firm</p> review786: money,ex,power, very good people to work with</p> review787: Fabulous perks, salary and fun environment!</p> review788: The leadership at the company is strong.

Benefits and perks are outstanding. You won&#039;t find a total compensation package this good anywhere else. Best of all, people look at you like you&#039;re a rock star when you tell them where you work.</p> review793: The perks of food and recreation are not everything. I am so happy to have been part of this amazing culture.</p> review793: Everything you hear about Google is true -- free perks, lunch, dinner, dentist on-site. It feels like an idealistic utopia. Lots of super smart people, but sometimes high ego and out of touch with reality.</p> review794: Motivated and intelligent coworkers. Good food, snacks, and drinks. Opportunities for business travel. Internal transfer is highly supported. Engaging work and the (potential) ability to have a large impact. People generally behave predictably and professionally.

Good benefits. Good job security.</p> review797: Friendly co-workers Food Intelligent atmosphere Good salary and benefits Encourage development</p> review798: Top notch talent... I&#039;ve never worked with such a collection of smart and passionate folks. Benefits are obviously among the best in the business. Tech support staff that&#039;s actually knowledgeable and responsive... stuff actually gets resolved quickly (may seem funny to harp on that but the point is... the company makes investments to make problems like this vanish)</p> review799: Only serve food for free. That&#039;s it</p> review800: Great company to work for...it was a great company to start an internship!</p> review801: Great people! Great Perks! Fun projects!</p> review802: The working environment, the pay</p> review802: It&#039;s a dream company to work for, with great benefits and an amazing work culture!</p> review803: I loved working all three positions, but the last one, there was a conflict with the Manager.</p> review804: is awesome company to work for</p> review805: The perks are excellent - Breakfast, Lunch and snacks provided. Great benefits and Parental leave if you are having kids. The people are fun to work with.</p> review806: Great workplace, the higher-ups really appreciate the workers.

Lots of amenities and a fun workplace</p> review812: In general, a very talented, Googley workforce - but unfortunately there are still some morons and jerks, but far fewer than other tech companies. The employees are usually very ethical, approachable, and mission-focused. The (well publicized) benefits are top notch, and the comp is at or slightly above industry average IMO. Managers are generally much higher caliber than any other Fortune 500 I&#039;ve worked at. People actually listen to your ideas no matter your level, as long as you exhibit clear thinking and support your claims. Obviously working here opens up a lot of future doors, and the internal transfer opportunities are varied and numerous (and encouraged). Work-life balance is about as good as you can get for a top tech company (flex hours, less pressure to be a workaholic), and it is a fairly family-friendly company.</p> review813: Strong management, great pay, out-of-this-world perks, many growth opportunities, and so much fun</p> review814: I liked the food and the benefits</p> review815: Ambitious projects, many products actually used by millions of people, certain level of autonomy including good W/L balance, great peaks, top notch salary.</p> review816: Culture, Perks, Pay (depending on role), benefits, really smart googley people</p> review817: Excellent benefits and great employee interactions.</p> review818: Great perks and benefits.

They also treat their employees very well and I always felt needed, which I think it is a very strong motivator aside from the perks. They are also very flexible with time off and working from home, which also I respect, because they understand that their employees have their own lives to lead and work dosent always come first.</p> review820: Free food, paternity leave, get to take a break and cool off outside, great environment, great company, great products, awesome</p> review820: - Mission driven, product focused company (I really respect and admire the co-founders) - Obviously all the perks that folks talk about (on-site doctors, many different cafes with its own themes, annual holiday gift, etc) - Great brand recognition - you can always feel validated when you tell people you work at Google - Truly a company that tries to be innovative and do good for society - Overall compensation that&#039;s hard to match unless you&#039;re going to Facebook (competitive base + yearly bonus + equity + all the perks of being at Google)</p> review821: A lot of the coworkers are extremely smart. You are given lots of responsibility and you have the ability to work on new and exciting products.</p> review822: Google is still overall a good place to work, It is not the great place to work it once was but its not the worst by any means. As it grows it has lots of big company bs and politics that come with that.

Great benefit for family</p> review904: Good environment. Friendly people. Gives you the sense of being important. Haven&#039;t seen micro managements. Flexible hours as expected.</p> review905: Google hires very smart people and allows them to participate in the culture. This means your coworkers will likely be very interesting and fun, and you&#039;ll probably enjoy the office environment immensely. You&#039;ll learn a lot. The hours are very flexible and the company takes the notion of work-life balance as it applies to the workday very seriously (though there&#039;s a dark reason for this). And the perks are second to none. Compensation is also quite competitive as you rise through the ranks. And the food! I still dream about the food. It&#039;s a great place to build a stable career if you love coding but aren&#039;t super-entrepreneurial and don&#039;t make tons of contributions to open source projects (see the cons for why these would be issues). The workplace environment is often replicated, but nobody else has matched it yet.</p> review906: -Flexible work schedule -Your opinion matters (usually) -great benefits -excellent compensation</p> review907: Great, smart people.

Vacation/time-off policies are quite generous. Employees are usually very respectful at personal level even if technical arguments can be heated. Lots of belief in experimentation/moonshot and not just holding tightly to what works.</p> review924: The obvious benefits of the office are all true. The company culture is friendly and supportive. There is low power distance with superiors.</p> review925: High impact stuff, fast paced, great benefits and perks</p> review926: Innovative, fast moving company that refuses to stand still.

You are surrounded by brilliant minds that are trying to solve complex problems. Top management have a vested interest in employee well being.</p> review932: The perks, (obviously). hmmm... thats really the only positive thing I can think of.</p> review933: Benefits, people, work-life balance, and company culture are all amazing. Couldn&#039;t think of a better place to spend the last year-plus</p> review934: Great company values, and a culture that really cares for human values.</p> review935: Good place to work.

The community is really amazing. Perks are unbelievable: free food, 401k and donation match, generous vacation schedule. I was able to maintain a very reasonable schedule and maintain a personal life even close to project deadlines.</p> review945: While the pay is good, perks are great, etc, far and away the best thing about working at Google is being able to take advantage of the font of knowledge available in your co-workers. People are genuinely helpful, with some astoundingly well-known names regularly chiming in to answer random questions on various internal mailing lists.</p> review946: Whenever I&#039;ve worked extra hard or stood out, I&#039;ve been rewarded with salary bumps and big bonuses. I like that my accomplishments are noticed by my manager and peers and rewarded accordingly.</p> review946: Best place to work. They have so many benefits, allow you to work 20% of time on your own projects, can bring dog to work, food court, exercise so much to love.</p> review947: While the pay is good, perks are great, etc, far and away the best thing about working at Google is being able to take advantage of the font of knowledge available in your co-workers. People are genuinely helpful, with some astoundingly well-known names regularly chiming in to answer random questions on various internal mailing lists.</p> review948: culture, perks and management are gret</p> review949: Great food and coworkers!

Google has done a great job of marketing themselves as a hip place for smart young things to work. The concerts, parties, and general go go go of the company may appeal to young 20 somethings who have no strings attached and like to spend 75 hours per week at work in a flexible schedule of working out, working, eating, getting massages and hardly ever going outside of the Google bubble. Google culture has its own language so you feel like part of a group. People &#034;get you&#034; here because they speak Google-esque just like you. Again, great marketing and appealing to the need for people to belong to a group.</p> review958: Food, people, work, culture, and overall atmosphere</p> review959: Google does value its employees and offers great benefits and perks. People are considerate and respectful.

Workloads are manageable.</p> review963: The benefits are unparalleled, compensation is extremely generous, a lot of opportunity if you&#039;re in the right place. Work/life balance is great (at least it is outside of Mountain View), and really dependent on the employee. Once you start working here, it is very easy to see why Google is always topping lists. Bad reviews are likely a result of someone who has never worked outside of the tech industry-they really don&#039;t know how good we have it.</p> review964: Smart coworkers, a great overall mission, fantastic perks, supportive environment, ability to achieve work/life balance.</p> review964: Good food at the various cafeterias</p> review965: Flexibility in everything, culture, learn from &amp; work with the best people in the industry.</p> review966: You can make a really big impact on the world working at google.

Colleagues cheer you on and are very supportive of one another even though there is a lot of competition. People are willing to jump in to get things done. It is relatively easy to jump between groups/orgs.</p> review972: Google has a lot of really smart people who come to work with a great attitude of wanting to do the right thing and make people around them successful. We are lucky to have leadership invest in their employees and really want to make the world a better place. We very rarely approach projects in a &#034;here is how we can save money&#034; approach but more in a here is how we can make a great user experience. The perks are great and the atmosphere is really relaxed and empowered to make a positive impact.</p> review973: People are amazing and doing the right thing.</p> review973: Free food and free drinks</p> review974: technical, smart people, open culture, flexible internal transfers</p> review975: Where else do you get to work on a product used by hundreds of millions of people?</p> review976: Well, it&#039;s Google:) You get exceptional perks, including subsidized massages and gourmet food. The average intelligence level of employees is very high and most of the technologies you work on are bleeding edge. The company tries to maintain open information culture and keep people aware of what is going on.</p> review977: Great perks, intelligent people, working on incredibly difficult problems.</p> review978: Young, creative mind, growth opportunity</p> review979: Work life balance, amazing talent, treat people really well, comp, benefits - you name it!</p> review980: Benefits: Google Stock, 401k matching, free food, free gym, free cell phone (in sales), work-life balance</p> review981: Vibrant work culture and numerous possibilities for professional growth.</p> review982: Everything was good about goodl</p> review982: Tremendous commitment to work/life balance, very tolerant of internal career changes, outstanding values.</p> review983: free lunch and snacks are great and the environment is very comfortable and approachable. one of the best places that i have ever worked at.</p> review984: Simple for every body and any where</p> review985: -Great environment -Chill people -Access to A LOT OF FOOD -A lot of free benefits -The office culture is really nice - we get to do some weekend activities like watching movies and eating out</p> review986: Very satisfied, this is a great company</p> review987: Benefits Pay Excitement of a fast moving tech company</p> review988: Company brand, integrity, strong future Company motto holds true pay, bonus work is challenging</p> review989: Good perks ok salary lots of smart people</p> review990: The people are mostly very intelligent and positive.</p> review991: This is a young Company with a Potential of Expansion</p> review991: Great people, challenging and impactful work, fast pace, professional growth</p> review992: Most Cool place to work.

When I need assistance from another engineer or another team, I typically get quick and effective help. Office politics exist, but compared to anywhere else I&#039;ve worked they&#039;re not a problem. - Compensation / perks: I&#039;m very satisfied with my compensation. The assorted perks are pretty valuable as well -- the food and fitness facilities are my favorites. - Work/life balance: From reading other reviews here it seems that experiences in this area vary. But mine have been excellent. I rarely work over 40 hours a week, and when I do it&#039;s because I personally feel engaged by what I&#039;m working on, never because of pressure from my manager or team lead. I almost never check work emails during evenings or weekends, and when I come in to the office in the morning I don&#039;t  find that they&#039;ve been emailing me during that period. I actually have gotten gentle pushback from my team lead when I asked if he could log in from home later in the evening to review/approve a change I wanted to submit.</p> review997: Fabulous talent with honest deliverable within the team. Dynamic environment with dynamic tools. On site exercise, on site weekly TED style presentations. Astonishing and amazing food.

I am able to create my own responsibilities and the folks I work with are incredibly intelligent, creating world changing consumer products.</p> review1003: Ability to move up in company</p> review1004: -Amazing people -Very few companies are innovating at this scale -Can move around internally, by location or fuction, pretty easily -Amazing place to learn, build network and gain perspective that is hard to get elsewhere -Company culture is fantastic. People can really be themselves and that is embraced.</p> review1005: Leader in tech innovation, amazing work culture, great benefits including free food, bus service and much more.

But the company attracts some of the best talent and best people to work with in the world, which is the most important bit. Potential impact is always huge, and it&#039;s great to wake up in the morning and hear that the company you work for is going to try and defeat death, or bring internet in balloons to rural areas.</p> review1074: perks, talent, infrastructure, brand recognition, exposure to other parts of the company</p> review1075: The supportive network of Googlers and office culture</p> review1076: Great coworkers and managers who really value you.</p> review1077: The company demands are high therefore it makes the work in turn easy.

Another pro is the variety of interesting products they are working on, there is very interesting work happening at Google in a variety of areas.</p> review1092: Great salary and benefits and resources. The amount of intelligent people working for this company can be a bit overwhelming and forces you to be the best.</p> review1093: There is a band of salaries at each level, and when you start at Google or transfer departments, you can and should negotiate because they will start low. I got +8% to base.</p> review1094: Great community atmosphere. Brilliant engineers who are humble, respectful, and go out of their way to help you. The perks are seriously insane -- delicious food, world-class gyms, etc. Unlike some other reviewers, I&#039;ve had no trouble with movement around the company. I will say that I started Google with a particularly excellent and supportive team, which means I got very good peer reviews, which made transfers to other teams quite easy. I&#039;ve seen others who get unluckily placed in a hohum team and have trouble getting out. I find work-life balance also quite reasonable, though it might help to be remote from the HQ.</p> review1095: Perks like free food, great gyms, shuttle services, etc Great company culture A lot of great networking events across departments Google grow classes that help you build on old skills or learn new ones</p> review1096: Very intellectual people from Admin to tech</p> review1097: - competitive package. - awesome benefit: free food, gym, micro kitchen, many benefits - unique culture to encourage to encourage innovation</p> review1098: Fun alot of resources. food is amazing.</p> review1099: good working environment,exposure,technology,work life balance</p> review1099: great company, great vision, enjoyable work.</p> review1100: Sense of community is really great, campus is beautiful.

Well-deserved reputation for having the industry&#039;s best software engineers.</p> review1102: Great processes, strong systems, smart hiring managers, excellent employment branding</p> review1103: The Google perks are ridiculous and well-documented. Benefits are amazing. Great learning environment. I worked as a recruiter for ~2 years at Google and learned way more about how to be a great recruiter than I did in the previous 6 years of my career, combined. Google, as a whole, genuinely cares about their employees.</p> review1104: Really Smart People to work with</p> review1105: perks, office culture, salary, benefits, personal growth</p> review1106: good pay, great community involvement and opportunity to travel the city and see new things</p> review1107: Great place to work, good work-life balance</p> review1108: Incredible perks, incredible autonomy, great coworkers, good pay, and interesting projects.</p> review1108: Lot&#039;s of ability to move around and move up if you work hard and learn the right skills.

Google tries its best to take care of everything else (within reason) so that you can focus on doing what you do best. Little things like: food, transportation, entertainment, and the right tools for the job ( computers, phones, and even desks)</p> review1127: Great working culture. Very engineer-driven company. You feel that you can do what you like and are appreciated for it. Not to mention the great perks (that can get very distracting).</p> review1128: Great benefits. Also great atmosphere. Make you feel young!</p> review1129: The company is extremely transparent internally, supports lifelong learning (if there is something you want to learn it is likely there is a class available on the topic), and you work with some of the smartest people around. The work environment is great, as is the food, fitness centers, and other added benefits.</p> review1130: Great company with great pay, benefits, and atmosphere.</p> review1131: Perks, benefits, pay, work-from-home policy, and really smart people. You don&#039;t run into morons here, and that makes life *so* *much* *better*. The tools available inside are better than anything that anyone can buy, and really have no equal. You have a bit of a raffle in terms of your manager, but really, just switch around when you can to find one that works well for you. Being at Google with a manager that you work well with is an optimal life situation</p> review1132: The benefits are some of the best in the valley.

You make things used every day by billions of people; or create data-driven algorithms on a scale not done anywhere else.

The press is sometimes cynical about the &#034;don&#039;t be evil&#034; mantra, but it&#039;s something the leadership is serious about. It comes out in the incredible (but quiet) care devoted to protecting the privacy of customer data; or in the care about employees (like healthy food, thoughtful benefits, etc).

The work is interesting and varied, the perks and compensation are great, and there&#039;s very little of the normal corporate BS that tends to distract people from their job at other companies.</p> review1202: Embraces innovation. Singularly focused on the end user. Go big or go home.</p> review1203: Despite it&#039;s size, Google continues to innovate, treat it&#039;s employees well, and have tough problems to solve. You can&#039;t go wrong by getting a job here. There are so many teams that if you don&#039;t find the perfect fit at first, just keep looking (which is easy!) and you&#039;ll probably find something to enjoy.</p> review1204: Everything! I only worked here for some time but I found that the employees were great and I really liked my boss :) :) :)</p> review1205: salary, stocks, work life balance, management, peers, it is a dream to work here everyday!</p> review1206: Can&#039;t beat Google&#039;s culture and perks. Caring and smart people everywhere. Some work is challenging (depends on your role).</p> review1207: Great place to work Smart people Amazing perks Changing the world in many dimensions, across industries and always looking for new opportunities</p> review1207: salary si good, and you can catch up with latest tech.</p> review1208: Very smart management in almost every department with clear, ambitious vision. Most people at the company are self starters and have a desire to improve whether its making the products, workplace services, or even things like food and transportation for employees.</p> review1209: Amazing perks, flexibility of hours and work/life balance. Laidback and collaborative work culture. Great opportunities for classes and personal development</p> review1210: campus perks and the people are really awesome</p> review1211: Free food and snacks.</p> review1212: Google takes care of its people. On the sales side, I enjoy a fantastic work/life balance and really love the work that I&#039;m doing in programmatic ad sales. Vacation time is fair, pay is fair, and the perks are insane.</p> review1213: Fantastic benefits. A culture that motivates a strong work ethic. Access to some of the worlds best leaders in areas of machine learning and large scale data algorithms.</p> review1214: Office Culture, Perks, Personal Growth, Free food, free bus rides</p> review1215: The benefits and perks of working at Google are outstanding. As a whole, I think the company does care about its employees, at the highest levels.</p> review1216: The rumors about the glamorous work environment at Google are true. You&#039;re in a comfortable workplace surrounded by the best people and practically smothered with perks.</p> review1216: Awesome company, amazing founders and senior management, and ofcourse, great perks. You feel a sense of pride, accomplishment and excitement walking into work every morning.</p> review1217: Good culture. Wacky HQ. Good Perks</p> review1218: Intelligent people, fantastic management, incredible foresight.</p> review1219: I have something to compare with. This is the place where you can spend life working on interesting problems, and picking the team where you want to work.</p> review1220: The perks are amazing, food, gym membership, transportation, massages, trainings all provided. If you&#039;re savvy enough you can find your way into working on some pretty cool things.</p> review1221: Flexible working schedule Easy job for lots of money: VERY EASY. 20% Projects are feasible if you find a way to get your work done in advance. Ex. hiring a freelancer via Odesk (very cheap rates) for the stuff you just don&#039;t feel like doing. &lt; smart people in jobs that are too junior get complacent and bored. Manager your managers expectations and they won&#039;t have a clue nor do they care as long as you deliver. Food / Snacks Shuttle Service Bathrooms with heated seats and bidet Smart co-workers MOMA: Googler Visibility with photos (ironically the search engine is awful) Campus vans vs. Riding bicycle in heels. Perks Resume Padder: Recruiters call everyday while at work! Choice of laptop, screens, erg setup. Tech Support: Free cords, batteries, adapters, galore! The coolest most legit people are the security staff.</p> review1222: Cool environment and everyone is really laid back, yet smart. it has a lot of food.</p> review1223: Work with very smart people Work on global scale projects that an have a huge impact Great work environment with a lot of perks Amazing company culture</p> review1224: Being able to show up to work dressed causally and not too stressful environment which allowed for growth and learning.</p> review1225: Amazing people, amazing benefits. The company spoils you for sure. I worked on the SMB Team and did connect well with many clients to help them understand the value of AdWords and get as much out of the product as they could.</p> review1225: Very many; the perks, the salary, the environment. Google knows that it has great culture and gets people thta it knows will continue that tradtiion</p> review1226: Ambitious with global scale and resources</p> review1227: Perks, perks and more perks.</p> review1228: Good work culture, Best package and chance to work on latest technology</p> review1229: An extraordinary supply of very smart, committed, hard-working, talented people. As far as corporate employment goes, Google has to be the diamond standard.</p> review1230: People, cultural, food. Depends on which manager and department you are in, but I get control of projects, am not micromanaged and feel I make a real impact.</p> review1231: time off policies and food</p> review1232: smart people, great environment, good chance to advance</p> review1233: I can say that one of the most great things here is the smart people. Also excellent ideas everywhere. People also are very friendly. Though the company is getting bigger, work is still having the start up flavor, at least in many teams I know.</p> review1234: Google wants to create and hire the worlds best people managers, and to that end they have more leadership &amp; management trainings, courses, frameworks, and resources than most business schools. And then there are the legendary benefits. Free food, possibly the best health insurance in the country, a great campus completely with gyms, pools, tons of green space, etc. It&#039;s a pleasure to be at work.</p> review1234: - Definitely Google provides the best perks...food, events, gym, lots of learning opportunities and cultural activities. It&#039;s like a living in a grown up college campus. - Great people to work with. Most of my teammates were emotionally balanced, pleasant, intelligent and fun.</p> review1235: This is the stuff everyone always hears about -- amazing benefits, top pay, free everything all the time in the office, etc. Plus the people are immensely talented and driven. Also, as much flak as the &#034;don&#039;t be evil&#034; mantra gets outside of Google, I tend to believe that the company is still largely operated in that way.</p> review1236: The collective intelligence level is off the charts. There is an emphasis on innovation. &#034;We can do it better.&#034; There is, generally, an atmosphere of mutual respect. The management walks their talk.</p> review1237: You work with the best, meals are better than restaurants, very little micromanagement in my group</p> review1238: The Google LA office is fantastic. The office is located in Venice just steps from the beach with some of the best facilities including a gym, dog park, roof deck, juice and coffee bar, and an amazing cafe. The office really grasps the Silicon Beach theme of the area</p> review1239: Super work culture I say</p> review1240: the offices inspire creativity. most importantly the executives are easily available and this allows for great insight on current projects.</p> review1241: The Mission statement. The Leadership (Larry has done a really good job IMHO of focusing the company). The People, really smart, really nice, usually, there are a couple of bad apples, no system is perfect.</p> review1242: There are great growth opportunities, from internal mobility, internal training, and tuition reimbursement (Google paid for me to go through graduate school). The company has still managed to mostly keep to the &#034;don&#039;t be evil&#034; mindset. You&#039;re constantly surrounded by really smart people.</p> review1243: Very good people working there</p> review1243: Incredibly intelligent, dedicated, motivated colleagues. Friendly environment. Opportunity to try something new after 1 year in a role. Decent benefits. Fun environment.</p> review1244: great benefits and smart people lots of resources to allocate</p> review1245: Great benefits and perks. Lots of challenging problems to solve. Unlimited resources (if you&#039;re working on the right things). Most important of all, an incredible mission.</p> review1246: Good environment, free food, and you work with the newest innovative products.</p> review1247: While those who come to Google right out to school may not realize it, Google is really Disneyland. Nowhere else in the world is there a company that offers the same breadth of opportunity, innovation and incredible support for its employees. It is *not* normal anywhere else to have three michelin star dining experiences, easy access dry cleaning and car detailing, gym and massage services and more.</p> review1248: Top talented people, great perks, creativities, moonshot projects.</p> review1249: the work isn&#039;t very tough and depend on your department. Be ready for business trip. Prepare your resume well.</p> review1250: Google gets that the less you have to pay attention to peripheral stuff and leave campus, the more you get done in a day. This means that on-site benefits are valuable and easy to access including health care, exercise, and personal care. It&#039;s a challenging environment that will make you play your A game.</p> review1251: The perks and environment of the company are well known, but the resources for professional growth are sometimes overlooked. There is no better company in tech or the Valley to accelerate your career and grow personally or professionally.</p> review1252: The energy, the people, the high level of talent.</p> review1252: The Company is Innovative and resourceful</p> review1253: very friendly and mentored a lot</p> review1254: Great perk on food and in-office massage learn something new everyday, Your idea can change the outcome for millions to use the product</p> review1255: great people and great perks</p> review1256: Great Env, Knowledgeable People Around, Good Pay</p> review1257: Smart people, great perks, and proud on working with greatest company in the world for now. Good life/work balance in general.</p> review1258: They treat people like adults - not checking up on your every move. There is a great sense of humour in the way they do things. The salary is great, and best of all, you get to make a difference to 100&#039;s of millions of people. -Amazing perks. - Great co-workers - Good work-life balance so far. Hardly anyone works at the weekend in my team and most people are out of the office between 5 and 6.</p> review1259: Awesome perks, access to great technology and resources, surrounded by very smart people.</p> review1260: Good co-workers, smart people move on fast. Get that name on your resume. Gives your leverage to get a good job afterwards.</p> review1261: Google has managed to recruit an excellent community of engineers. Engineers are friendly, and very knowledgeable. Generally, management has made the community collaborative, rather than competitive or contentious. It is a wonderful environment where your software skills are valued and nurtured, and where you can learn from your peers, some of whom are leaders in various sections of the field.</p> review1261: Amazing people, learning opportunities and perks. Interesting own culture you can learn a lot from. Every programmer should experience working here.</p> review1262: The perks are unbelievable. The culture is awesome. Lots of great travel opportunities</p> review1263: Great benefits and a friendly environment where professional and personal growth is encouraged.</p> review1264: Great benefits and perks depending on the office you&#039;re located in. Larger offices have more &#034;Google&#034; options like gym, robust cafes, massages, and ample training classes. The salary is also competitive when you factor in all of the benefits. However, many other companies are becoming &#034;Googley&#034; so beware that it isn&#039;t the same it was 5 years ago. All departments are different but the best ones everyone wants to get into are HR, Benefits, Events, and Admin, and Operations. Stay clear of any sales department!</p> review1265: The daily benefits are great -- flexible schedule, free meals, and a young, exciting culture.</p> review1266: -For a large corporation Google is still amazingly open and transparent about company objectives and results. -If you&#039;re an engineer, it&#039;s The Holy Grail. Engineers will always be at the top of the pecking order when it comes to compensation, bennies, etc. -Despite its size, Google is still willing to take big risks in the name of innovation.</p> review1267: Google has the most amazing people - super smart, driven, good-natured, great pay &amp; benefits/perks. So much amazing innovation all around you!</p> review1268: salary, tasks, culture, perks, leadership</p> review1269: Great culture, Great leaders, Amazing transparency</p> review1270: Great talented co-workers, excellent perks, generally busy at work.</p> review1270: People actually care here. That&#039;s what I loved about working at Google; every day I came in and felt like the people I worked with genuinely wanted to know how my life/career was going. This was a fantastic feeling, and it made me excited to return every day.</p> review1271: Smart and collaborative coworkers, great benefits and perks, open and fun environment.</p> review1272: Challenging work with many different projects to work on.</p> review1273: All the usual good stuff about Google: free food and good comp.</p> review1274: Working here has been very fulfilling.

Great environment to learn in. High expectations. You need to be able to upramp quickly and come up to speed on emerging bleeding edge technologies in short order.</p> review1277: Within my team, we have a particularly flat hierarchy, though it can be quite hierarchical when interfacing with executives above our team. We have opportunities for mutual feedback with coworkers, a strong focus on increasing team well-being/happiness, lots of team bonding events, and a high drive towards personal growth. The overall company has an atmosphere of conviviality that is energizing.</p> review1278: Great people and big challenges to work on. They really take care of their people.</p> review1279: Excellent compensation, benefits, perks, possibility of travel, variety, opportunities to take on lots of different projects, freedom to define the scope and direction of work, smart people.</p> review1279: The diversity of opportunity. Google touches so many industries from ad-tech to consumer software and hardware. There is something for everyone at Google and it&#039;s very easy to find a role on a product that you truly care about.

Great opportunities to work cross platforms and cross geographies.</p> review1286: Google was a great place to launch my career. As someone who was interested in launching my own company, I cannot overstate what it means to have Google on my resume. I&#039;ve gotten interviews at top startup incubators and meetings with VC&#039;s based off the Google creds alone. The people who work here are also just incredible and highly motivated. If you&#039;re looking to just blend in and fall through the cracks, this isn&#039;t the place to be. I mean that in a good way. It&#039;s a great place to learn too. There are so many incredible resources to take advantage of that can just make a more well-rounded person.</p> review1287: A lot of contacts with different people, good knowledge, a lot of information, no borders, good teachers, good friends, high culture.</p> review1288: Can&#039;t speak to whole company, but my team treated my well. Obviously a ton of perks/benefits and generally good comp. Very comfy living. Would be hard to leave here except to go to a startup.</p> review1288: The perks are top notch</p> review1289: • Compensation • Benefits • Offices are fun • Infinite opportunities to learn</p> review1290: The colleagues you&#039;ll work with is the best part about being here.

Your co-workers tend to be incredibly nice, hard working, interesting people. Larry&#039;s vision is pretty amazing and he&#039;s helped create a great environment to work in. Having visited many tech companies, I really believe Google&#039;s perks are second to none - especially if you consider how many offices it has!</p> review1299: I worked for Google 3 times as a contractor before converting to full time employment. The perks are amazing and can&#039;t be beat. Almost all the cafes are top notch and the microkitches are fully stocked. During my time there, I met some of the most powerful people in the world, was entertained by some of the greatest bands and met some of my favorite authors. The annual holiday party is also exceptional and no cost seems to be spared.</p> review1300: good atmosphere in the company</p> review1301: Good compensation, fun and challenging problems</p> review1302: Incredibly smart people, challenging work, good management, and excellent perks and compensation make this a great place to work.</p> review1303: This is the best place in the world.so many new ideas and innovations that impact the world, and to be apart of that is completely riveting.</p> review1304: Very data driven culture.Engineering is respected and heard a lot.

Free food is just the beginning, although parents of small kids will find it especially liberating to bring them over for dinner after a hard day of work rather than cooking. There are weekly TGIF meeting swhere pretty much all important confidential company plans are shared with employees and the later have an opportunity to ask any questions they wish to Larry, Sergey and any presenters. Quality of coworkers rocks. Managers are restricted to people/project decisions and do not interfere in technical aspects of the job. There are always parties, gifts, events and learning opportunities of both technical and personal nature. This is definitely a place where you can work 9-5 and prioritize family, school events and so on if you so choose. If you are a workaholic, you will definitely be accommodated. While the later group may justifiably receive promotions and pay hikes, but the former will not  fired or mistreated for their choices. If you have what it takes, join and never look back!</p> review1316: food is amazing and the people are smart</p> review1317: innovative, think big, move fast</p> review1318: Work life balance, best in Industry salary, good work environment and area expertise.</p> review1319: Lots of responsibility and autonomy Flexible work schedule Perks Feel like you&#039;re making an impact Surrounded by really smart people</p> review1320: Everyone knows the perks.

We have a great amount of resources at our fingertips. With a couple of commands, I can run a service on thousands of machines worldwide. We have access to pretty much what we need to do our job. Because Google is involved in a large number of industries, there are plenty of opportunities abound to find something that you&#039;re interested in. We are highly encouraged to move around the company. The company really takes care of us professionally and personally. The benefits are incredibly high. My team has been on offsites to Tahoe, Vegas, and Hawaii in the last year. The company creates an environment where you don&#039;t really want to leave campus. Lastly, being on the inside and seei ng all of the technology before it launches is really like seeing the future. Some of the unannounced products that we&#039;re working on is science fiction.</p> review1327: - lots of smart people - state of the art technology - excellent IT support - never need to worry about your desk equipment</p> review1328: cool project and brilliant coworkers.

The benefits and perks and overall environment make it a wonderful company to work for.at Google activities are provided to help is your mind or give yourself a break in order to be able to come back to whatever project it is that you are working with a fresh mind.

Flexible hours and generous ability to take time off and work from home.

You&#039;re surrounded by brilliant people who work hard, get things done, and inspire you to elevate your game. There are inspiring, world-changing projects all around you, and even if you have not yet had the opportunity to work on one, I find satisfaction just being able to observe from the inside. Larry has done an amazing job transforming the company from one known for world-class engineering to one that also understands and appreciates design and the more human side of building great products. Maybe most of all, I love working at a place that values human rights, diversity, and acceptance.</p> review1333: Google has the GREATEST perks in the world!</p> review1333: People are very smart and nice, environment is like a college - promoting learning through work, and the salary is very competitive.</p> review1334: Whip smart people; A meritocracy where smart people are listened to; They are willing to allocate amazing amount of resources to solve problems.

Be there early, stay late, do everything your&#039;re asked to and three or four times that. Go out with your coworkers, go out with your boss, become a Googler even though you aren&#039;t. Yes the pay sucks, but you have an opportunity to get your foot in the door. Introduce yourself to Larry and Sergei, make sure they know who you are. Do your job well, and don&#039;t be shy about telling others what you are excited about. It&#039;s a collaboration mecca. You can learn a lot while you&#039;re here, and you can pick a lot of brains that you may never get to rub elbows with again.

We play board games every week, we talk about ACM papers, we diagnose devilish bugs and find creative ways to solve problems, we pair program and hack out experimental prototypes, and we learn together.

It opens up opportunities for you.</p> review1441: Great smart engineers with a mission.</p> review1442: Had to add my own thoughts after seeing so many concerns about work-life balance at Google. I joined Google about a year ago after many years in mid-tier management consulting. For me, it&#039;s been a refreshing return to work-life balance. No, that doesn&#039;t mean I work 35 hr weeks. I&#039;m often at Google before 7am and sometimes stay past 7pm. I work hard because I want to be the best in my profession, because I believe I should earn all those perks Google is famous for, and because my team, who want to be the best in their professions, are relying on me. That said, I&#039;ve never worked into the wee hours of the morning. Every Saturday and Sunday you&#039;ll find me outside running or biking, not in the office. I have a wonderful marriage, get 8 hrs sleep every night and am fortunate to be leaving a happy life. In contrast, my consulting career was full of 70 hr workweeks, travel away from my family, unbelievable levels of stress and piles of politics. M aybe Google is also like this at the VP and SVP level, I&#039;m not sure. But I&#039;m about half way up the so-called corporate ladder and, at least from my perspective, things are refreshingly balanced and authentic. Again, I&#039;m only 1 year in so take my thoughts with a pinch of salt. The other myth I&#039;d like to debunk (actually, it appears to already be long-before debunked) is that only ivy-grads can get into Google. From what I&#039;ve heard, this was more true 10 years ago. But, I attended a small undergrad school you&#039;ve probably never heard of and haven&#039;t been back to school since. I think what Google is looking for is the same as any company: people with honest passion for their trade, who don&#039;t mind putting in some elbow grease to keep the company growing.</p> review1443: great benefits, culture, teammates, opportunities</p> review1444: Proactive attitude about preventing the accumulation of technical debt. Brilliant coworkers. Interesting and challenging work.</p> review1445: Perks, work/life balance, feel valued, little bureacracy</p> review1446: Challenging navigating through the organized Chaos</p> review1447: It&#039;s like working and playing at a university campus that happens to be called Google. Awesome perks to appease those in their 20s and 30s. Great for living up your fresh-out-of-college years. The first few years feel new, shiny, and amazing. Google is practically mecca for engineers.</p> review1448: Good Benefits, Work Culture, Flexible Timings</p> review1449: Good employees and work place</p> review1450: Smart colleagues, good food, good work environment, opportunities to do what you want through internal transfers.</p> review1450: The work schedule is pretty flexible.</p> review1451: Strong, not best, benefits/comp, easy work/life balance</p> review1452: casual and comfortable, free gourmet food, recreational equipment, genuinely friendly people, smart coworkers who work hard and won&#039;t give you the &#034;could you explain __?&#034; stall tactic (or they&#039;re bright enough they&#039;re never confused about what you mean) once you&#039;re in, Google likes to keep employees and it&#039;s easy to move laterally to another position if the one you&#039;re in has its project cut or something</p> review1453: Lots of free time and I really got into shape but thats ok, because now I&#039;m a happy person.</p> review1454: Great challenges, not a lot of politics in the area I work. Opportunities arise if you are resourceful to go work in start up like environments within a very large company.</p> review1455: The people. The environment. The technology. Working at Google is really a unique experience that makes you grow.</p> review1456: Benefits, perks, and the people. Everyone around you is smart and tend to get along well with one another. The benefits are great and I only pay roughly 250/mo for a large family.</p> review1457: The best part about working at google is the culture. Everyone is friendly and amazingly smart which has inspired me to be innovative in the way I approach projects.</p> review1458: The work is cutting edge and career-making. By the contacts you make and the experience you can have, as well as the name on your resume, it is door-opening. You will work with one of the smartest collections of people in the world, with every perk known in employment. One thing I&#039;ll say is that shared offices are often seen as a negative but are actually quite a plus for most people.</p> review1459: 1. Free food, this is the best part in Google. 2. Talented people around you, and you will learn in day to day activities.</p> review1459: The people at Google are amazing and great to work with. Pay, perks, and benefits are excellent. There is some new challenge to solve each day and the impact that you can have is monumental.</p> review1460: Great pay, amazing benefits, great perks, and stock options.</p> review1461: Diversity and lots of talented people in there, management style of 7:1 and very each to communicate with manager and director, peers are wonderful and love the 360 peer review system</p> review1462: everything was pretty much great</p> review1463: Good work/life balance. I get to work with incredibly talented and driven people— no driftwood! Google is always working on a thousand different things, so there&#039;s always opportunities to try something new. Amazing MTV campus facilities and staff, free food, and incredible compensation. I can&#039;t think of anywhere else I&#039;d rather work.</p> review1464: Free transit (get driven, wireless access) Free food (3meals/daily + snacks and espresso)</p> review1465: Working at Google was refreshing but also shows that your life is suppose to be dedicated to work. They offer almost any amenity that you will possibly need so as to keep you working. All in all that isn&#039;t a bad thing but have a balance of work and life is paramount if you don&#039;t want to burn out. My position was transitionary so I did not experience the full intensity of the work life, but I was around it and could see the affects.But, there too are great perks and I did experience those!</p> review1466: Great perks and benefits. Peers can start to become like family when a bond is formed. International travel opportunity. Hands on experience with new products and technology.</p> review1467: Youthful culture. Relative lack of politics</p> review1468: Challenging everyday work. Opportunities for professional growth (really, lots of tech talks, people like Sanjay Ghemawat, Rop Pike, etc that you can talk every day in the hallway, invited guests (like Joel Spolsky, Guido van Rossum)), tons of great trainings, interesting projects). Awesome perks. Again, great people working with you. Again, people who are really enthusiastic about work they are doing (e.g. we have weekly whisky meetings where we share and discuss work challenges, news and achievements while having glass of good whisky) We organize white paper read clubs and discussions, and so forth. Sergey and Larry entertaining you every Thursday discussing what&#039;s happening in the company and answering your questions. 20% projects (they are not dead, you can always come up with creative and useful stuff and people welcome it). Strong nerdy/engineering culture.</p> review1468: Good company, management lets you do your work, very flexible</p> review1469: Amazing career opportunities and a great place to jumpstart your career. There is a good amount of lateral mobility within the company which is great if you want to make a job change without switching companies.</p> review1470: great team work spirits and communication</p> review1471: Working at a company where amazing things are made, the people are smart and the food is amazing.</p> review1472: Good company, Good People, Great Place</p> review1473: Google is really a fantastic place to work. You get to engage with challenging, exciting problems at the height of your intelligence, in a community of passionate, brilliant peers.</p> review1474: Free food, everyone is extremely nice and Googlely, bikes everywhere, massage chairs</p> review1475: As far as big companies go, I&#039;m convinced that Google is the best place to work. You simply cannot beat the quality of your coworkers, the perks, the benefits... Google is a company that truly cares for their employees.</p> review1476: Everything is wonderful here!

Great perks, very comfortable.</p> review1480: Amazing environment, full of energy and a positive attitude</p> review1481: Love the work, I have a great team, I love the companies mission statement and I believe in their leadership.

People are generally friendly, smart and fun to work with.</p> review1534: Google is the only place I can think of whose majority of employees have a love/hate relationship with it. In a recent survey, most employees said that they were dissatisfied with their career direction/growth and that they were generally unhappy with the scope of their work. At the same time, the vast majority of employees believe in the direction the company is going and believe in senior leadership and would strongly recommend Google as a place to work. Smart enough to know they are capable of so much more and happy enough to not care? Let the good times roll! If you were a fan of 90210, you are almost too old to work there but just young enough to appreciate the &#039;perks.&#039; Some really super cool people who will hopefully find another really cool place to work and do something great with their lives. BBQ and the other food is ok too For the few who get to work on really cool things that matter, life is good. Highly competitive games of simple conversati on.</p> review1535: Great team atmosphere. Solid perks.</p> review1536: The people at Google are phenomenal - the smartest and most capable people I have worked with. And they&#039;re friendly and easy to work with too - very few jerks - everybody there is generally trying to do the right thing. Also, once you&#039;re in, it&#039;s relatively easy to move around - I have had three different jobs within Google</p> review1537: It pays well and it has a lot of resources to support big projects. Many of your coworkers will be smart. A few will be brilliant.</p> review1538: Great benefits, good atmosphere, good pay and bonus</p> review1539: Fun place to work, great team mates, many interesting projects,</p> review1540: High concentration of talent and interesting projects</p> review1540: Just what you would expect- exciting, innovative and creative culture, it is Google people! Perks, pay and people are a plus as well.</p> review1541: Huge impact Great culture Smart people Mission driven company Cutting edge of innovation</p> review1542: Work life balance, Food, Atmosphere, Smart people</p> review1543: The well known perks are all there. You are given quite a bit of freedom and autonomy within your project or teams scope. The work is challenging and interesting.</p> review1544: benefits, campus, it is Google</p> review1545: -great, smart people -large impact -exciting company to be a part of -consistent global culture -get to work on products that are used by millions of people and businesses</p> review1546: Amazing work life balance and compensation</p> review1547: Great compensation, amazing perks, and incredibly passionate coworkers. While most companies will claim that people are their number on priority, Google is the only company I&#039;ve worked at that actually delivers on this. My wife actually almost cried when she learned about the generous paternity leave policy and the &#034;death benefit&#034; provided by the company if anything should ever happen to me. It&#039;s overwhelming to see an employer go so far above and beyond just to make their employee&#039;s families lives better. I won&#039;t say too much about pay other than that my total compensation this year will be 2.5 times what I received at my previous employer ~2 years ago as a Software Engineer.</p> review1548: They treat employees very well. Not just be feeding us, but by giving us some degrees of freedom to work on what we want. They pay a lot of attention to employee feedback and actually make changes based on what we say. The technology is amazing and the people here are as smart as they come. More than likely, the &#034;guy who wrote the book on it&#034; works here.</p> review1549: Excellent benefits: free food, massages, great campus and awesome team mates. Great pay and work ethic. The trips overseas are fun too.</p> review1549: awesome benefits, good pay, reasonable company values</p> review1550: Great benefits, plain and simple. The stock still seems to have some legs. The company leads amazing projects on the edge via the Google X division</p> review1551: Google is a massive organization. So what one would experience in one part may not hold true for the rest of the company. I truly enjoyed my work there. Its amazing to see how people start looking at you differently the moment you tell them you are working for Google. Try not to take the &#034;smart&#034; thing too seriously.</p> review1552: Great environment, less work pressure and advanced technologies.</p> review1553: The legendary perks, the smart people, the do-gooding company ethos--it&#039;s all true and it&#039;s something to be thankful for every day.</p> review1554: amazing culture, good company, compatible work environment and work flexibility. I have loved to work for my company so far. It is a superb company</p> review1555: Good salary, Excellent Benefits, Excellent Campus</p> review1556: Environment that encourages everyone to stretch themselves with well aligned goals.</p> review1557: As a contractor, I was able to take advantage of free meal benefits and company facilities. Great team.</p> review1558: - Enjoy coming to work every single day - Do cool stuff that acutally matters - Fun and smart Co-workers - Google really invests in their employees</p> review1558: Amazingly talented people doing courageous work.</p> review1559: The roles have been challenging, dynamic, interesting, ambiguous and evolving. The people that I&#039;ve gotten to work with are great (for the most part)--smart, driven, effective--they&#039;re what has kept me around for so long.</p> review1560: Loved making my own work schedule and hours.</p> review1561: The job is good, food is good, money is okay. It is a great place to start your career since the company is so reputable.</p> review1562: Lots to learn, job culture is very unique, co-workers are very helpful and engaging</p> review1563: Finding top talent around the world for a great company.</p> review1564: They do a lot of things with computers</p> review1565: Some of the perks. being part of IT history</p> review1566: Attracts the smartest people, benefits are as good as you read about.</p> review1567: everything a big company can offer and what you do changes the world</p> review1567: Ability to interact with very unique and intelligent co-workers Numerous employee perks (free food, fitness centers, events, massage, etc.)</p> review1568: Great starting salary out of college, amazing coworkers, FOOD</p> review1569: + Opportunities to learn new skills + Upper management support of career goals + Free onsite food and gym + Shuttle service to get to work + Top notch benefits</p> review1570: Work life balance. Great beta tech to play with</p> review1571: life work balance is best here, no too much work</p> review1572: - Entertainment! Yes, there is a workout room, pool tables, ping pong tables, Foosball tables, Xbox 360&#039;s, Playstation 3s, Wii !! - FOOD!! Ice Cream freezer, cookies, snacks of all sorts, gourmet and normal beverages free for the taking! Breakfast and Lunch are all homemade from Chefs with nothing ever frozen.</p> review1573: Culture and perks are great. I can&#039;t think of another place I&#039;d rather work.</p> review1574: Endless perks like: massages, breakfast, lunch, dinner, gyms, trainings, micro kitchens, volleyball, shuttle service</p> review1575: Working with smarts people who work hard and play hard</p> review1576: great benefits, helpful co-workers, good atmosphere, innovative environment full of tech savvy people</p> review1576: Great culture, great perks. The work is challenging and rewarding</p> review1577: Free food is amazing.Great atmosphere, people work together and help each other. No strict rules on hours. Many tech talks that you can attend freely to learn.</p> review1578: -perks are out of this world -very steep career + pay growth (eg you can move up quickly if you do well) -flatter organization -given lots of opportunity and responsibility -dynamic -mission is fulfilling -amazing people -fun culture, familial</p> review1579: The job offers the rare opportunity to make big impact to life of millions of people. I work with extremely smart people and everyone is excited to come to work everyday. With all different kinds of project in Google, I can alway find something that interests me.</p> review1580: Perks, products &amp; innovation mixed with a fantastic culture</p> review1581: One word: money. The compensation, including the stock, is very good, and there aren&#039;t many other places that pay so well. The benefits are OK too but you need to be careful: for example, they have good insurance policies but by default they push you towards the bad ones.</p> review1582: people: supportive, friendly, smart, helpful</p> review1583: The perks are well known by now--not every office is like the one in Mountain View, but you&#039;ll find that they all are better than your average work facility.</p> review1584: great resources, perks, good internal opportunities</p> review1585: Benefits are good. Shuttle transportation can be useful for many people. Occasionally there are interesting talks (but conference rooms are often way too tiny.)</p> review1585: High Reputation, Good Payment, Balance Life</p> review1586: Growth opportunity at any level Friendly working atmosphere Lots of facilities for employees and no discrimination for contractors also. Work flexibility Well optimized business processes and policies Diversified culture Moderate pay structure</p> review1587: Very cool work culture. Open minded leaders</p> review1588: Perks and awesome projects/experience. Great culture and the ability to work with a lot of smart people.</p> review1589: * Great perks * Stable work environment * Fun work environment</p> review1590: - extremely smart and firendly peers and managers - open-minded and inclusive culture - working on huge-scale, high-impact products and services - drive to innovate on all levels in areas - big exposure, always in the news - plenty of learning opportunities</p> review1591: Great people, great perks. The work is interesting, and there can be a great &#039;if it is broke, go fix it&#039; atmosphere.</p> review1592: Great perks (food, trips, holiday gifts, etc), variety of interesting work, get to work with really smart people, chance to dogfood really cool stuff.</p> review1593: - Benefits - Great people - Exposed to awesome ideas</p> review1594: Career development is always top of mind for managers at Google. I love that we can work on a variety of projects.</p> review1594: * work with brilliant, motivated, caring people * excellent perks: free food, massages, flexible work schedule, wifi supported commute * extremely fast paced: room for creative problem solving, new challenges</p> review1595: its a wonderful place to work and the staff is amazing. I have learned so much from working here and can&#039;t wait to presume my career in the software engineering field.</p> review1596: The ability to bring fresh ideas to the table. It&#039;s a very creative environment and employees are given broad leeway to implement new things.</p> review1597: Incredible perks, enormously intelligent and motivated people, lots of freedom to do as you want, competent to great managers</p> review1598: Tons of smart people. Arguably the most interesting problems in computer science are being tackled on a daily basis -- certainly at an unparalleled scale. Different product areas have different cultures, so it&#039;s hard to generalize about the company as a whole, but I don&#039;t think any other company offers as good a combination of interesting projects, great benefits and compensation, smart co-workers, and good culture. It is worth noting that your experience can vary a lot depending on your product area and manager.</p> review1599: fun experience, it was a blast, golden, a lot of work. work hard, play harder.</p> review1600: Co-workers are super awesome and friendly, Free meals , High salary</p> review1601: they give much to employees (and contractors/temps)</p> review1602: all of the best reasons center around the perks (campus, food, gym, on site haircuts, on site medical doctor, etc.)</p> review1603: Everyone is friendly and the company is moving in an innovative direction</p> review1603: Never boring. Constantly changing. Pay for performance.</p> review1604: lots of opportunities to grow, great benefits, awesome free food/drinks :)</p> review1605: Excellent work environment, great perks, great people, changing society and technology, very innovative, trusting workplace. If you get bored with a project, the company has a million other cool and exciting things you can work on instead.</p> review1606: Wonderful community of very talented employees and senior management</p> review1607: open culture, ample learning, good food, cool workspace</p> review1608: Free food, great hardware, cool campus, amazing benefits</p> review1609: --perks and benefits are the best; all the stories are true --smart, fun people --challenging, interesting work</p> review1610: -lunches were provided -the schedule was flexible -incredibly smart people</p> review1611: No other company jthinkss as big</p> review1612: Amazing vision and really amazing people</p> review1612: As other people mentioned before, the perks are amazing (food, shuttle, gym, massages, etc.) but the best at Google is the people. There is no &#034;blame game&#034; around. Everyone is working hard to help the company and the products to succeed.</p> review1613: Amazing vision and really amazing people</p> review1614: - Great salaries - Great career path and opportunities - Good work environment</p> review1615: The people I work with are great. From everyone that I talk to, everyone says all the free food in the world can&#039;t replace the caliber of people one works with... I totally agree. Onsite massage therapist and all the food you can eat is great but the people I work with are smart, forward thinking, and thinking about what is best for the users and company.</p> review1616: -Free breakfast, lunch, dinner -gyms located all around campus -drinks -awesome, intelligent people -speakers that drive creative thinking outside of your regular path -bowling alley -pool tables everywhere -great looking campus -easily collaborate internally with google apps</p> review1617: - Great talent - Fast Paced - Wonderful culture of innovation I have met wonderful people at this company who truly inspire. They are smart, efficient, and almost everyone goes the extra mile. It&#039;s a company that values kindness as well (Don&#039;t Be Evil!) The people who don&#039;t fall into this category are so rare that they almost become special in their own right- shooting stars of below-average performance. Most everyone is fantastic.</p> review1618: Technologically challenging projects, excellent co-workers to work with.</p> review1619: free food... free food. free</p> review1620: smart people amazing perks strong brand that opens a lot of doors still lots of innovation</p> review1621: Great Perks! Team collaboration, transparency and trust from management to manage your business.</p> review1621: The network, people, community, and the access to information.</p> review1622: Solid management team, good pay, great benefits and perks.</p> review1623: - Free food - Shuttles - Smart people - Flexible hours - 20% time</p> review1624: Freedom to pursue self-identified projects, supportive and competent co-workers, and., of course, lots of free food.</p> review1625: Unlimited resources. Leading products. Smart energetic co-workers. Great perks.</p> review1626: Name recognition, excellent benefits, develop tech skills, internal mobility, additional responsibility, feeling of importance and challenge.</p> review1627: In order of importance: 1. A strong culture of creativity, innovation and avoiding unnecessary hierarchy, red tape and inertia. 2. Intellectually stimulating work. Even projects that sound boring at first become interesting when dealing with the challenges of doing them at Google scale. 3. Great perks. These make working at Google more fun, but also improve the culture. Free, really good food encourages teams to get away from their desks and eat together instead of just eating a boring, practical lunch at their desks. Various events such as ski trips are clearly designed to encourage people from different parts of the company to get to know each other. Tech talks are designed to create a culture of always learning instead of stagnating and becoming too settled in a small niche.</p> review1628: Great programs and some great people</p> review1629: Awesome people to work with. Good environment.</p> review1630: Smart, hard-working, well-rounded people. Interesting, challenging projects. Good compensation &amp; benefits. Get to do work that really maters.</p> review1630: Great people, great product, great company, great benefits</p> review1631: Awesome perks. Tons of fun. You get to work on projects that have either never been built before, or never been built at this scale before.</p> review1632: The only place I&#039;ve ever worked where I&#039;ve been criticized for not thinking big enough. Really smart people. A great place to incubate ideas. You are constantly pushed. I worked and launched a wide variety of products. Google is also big enough that it&#039;s difficult to get bored - there are always interesting projects to get involved with.</p> review1633: Great company to work for fresh Graduates who just passed out or people who are looking for entry level jobs.</p> review1634: Perks, Travel, Food, Culture, People</p> review1635: Flexibility, free breakfast, lunch, and, dinner. Fun environment. Great working culture. Smart co-workers. Good room for advancement.</p> review1636: - Perks/food/offices - Innovation - Leader in the industry. Your design and creation will set the tone.</p> review1637: Perks, co-workers, food, shuttle, hammocks</p> review1638: All engineers get to code a lot.</p> review1639: pay is absolutely great- my opinion</p> review1639: All engineers get to code a lot.</p> review1640: Very good total compensation and benefit</p> review1641: Great and fun place to work, health benefits, fun people to work with room to develop.</p> review1642: Work from home, anytime you can, even on weekends.</p> review1643: Great culture and people. All the notorious perks make it a comfortable place to work.</p> review1644: Management is very supportive and projects always involve new and exciting challenges. Great place to work.</p> review1645: Working at Google is simply awesome. The cultural values are great and I can fully identify myself with the companies visions. The people here are all really smart and always try to push the envelope of what&#039;s possible.</p> review1646: smart and fun people, random perks, lots of resources, personable management, quirky</p> review1647: Classes on many subjects. Free food.</p> review1648: I began at Google pre-IPO so my experience is based on the way the company evolved over time from a smallish company of less than 600 employees, to the tens of thousands that work there today. Google is, as expected, an incredible place to work. Your colleagues will be brilliant and the work environment is world-class. The projects are interesting and there is the constant state of wonder you will get when seeing work you completed actually deployed, and used, by people all over the world. On top of that, the company allows for incredible personal development, both professionally and with regards to non-work related interests. Guest speakers and lectures have ranged from celebrity visitors, to heads of state, to famous bloggers with specific domain expertise like &#034;The Strobist&#034; whose blog is followed by the photography cognoscenti.</p> review1648: Profitable, pays well, great benefits.</p> review1649: Great company to work for</p> review1650: Google has lots of smart people working on many exciting projects. The perks and benefits are unbelievably good. Management is very open with employees about what&#039;s going on with the company. Google is one of the most impact-full companies in the world.</p> review1651: Some of the most brilliant minds have solved many of infrastructure&#039;s big woes today. Learning how it&#039;s done is quite exciting. Also, free food everywhere, awesome campus, and travel opportunities.</p> review1652: Never been happier at a company. Lots of challenges everyday, and you work with the brightest people in the world. Unlike a lot of big companies, people are willing to help one another. Big Google also tries to foster meritocracy, and every year they have a company wide survey that helps lower, middle, and upper management know what to improve directly from tens of thousands of Googler feedback.</p> review1653: Working on products that have a global impact Changing the world Intelligent and diverse coworkers Amazing internal resources Exciting office spaces They really care about you as a person and want you to succeed, both inside and outside the office</p> review1654: Free food/young team, play hard, work hard</p> review1655: - Great, great perks. They really make you feel taken care of as an employee and as a person. - Great pride when you realize how the company is changing the world in a positive way and you are part of it. - Really nice people with not many big egos.</p> review1656: I was an intern here and I had my first experience with real-world delivery of apps. Good stuff</p> review1657: It is the best for programmer, you can learn a lot from other excellent people. So strongly recommend google. it is worth for working and paying</p> review1657: awesome perks and decent compensation</p> review1658: Zero politics, awesome products, open and supportive culture. Getting to play with the internal infrastructure is amazing. Many things still happen at a grassroots level so you can really help shape the company and it&#039;s products. Employees are encouraged to openly question and debate if the company is doing the right thing. In my group management is almost non existent which I think is a good thing. Getting to work at an engineering center in downtown Manhattan. Perks are as good as everyone says.</p> review1659: The people are the best thing about Google. There is a can-do attitude and when you work for a company where its employees review each other, this will humble even the most egotistical of coworkers. The company perks are definitely top notch, too, though in the end it is the camaraderie that I experiences is what I miss.</p> review1660: Smart, motivated people make it fun to come to work every day. Products that touch many millions of people and make their lives easier. Prestigious employer makes finding your next job very easy - people love seeing Google on your resume ... even after you&#039;ve been gone for years.</p> review1661: salary, benefit, google van, technology</p> review1662: A great company with a great history that still allows you to make contributions that can have significant impact. Awesome work culture.</p> review1663: Smart people and on-scale opportunities.</p> review1664: Best company I have ever even heard of, much less worked at</p> review1665: great things to work on.</p> review1666: In my experience, Google is an awesome place to work if: - you get intrinsic enjoyment from writing code - even when asked to spend months coding something for reasons that are unclear or less than inspiring (like lack of planning, inter-group politics, inertia, etc.) - you like reading code, doing code reviews, and having access to the entire source code of most google products. - you plan to work here for at least several years and like the idea of spending your first 3 to 6 months getting familiar with the large number of google-only systems, tools, libraries and coding practices that must be known even before doing small internal projects - even though this knowledge will be mostly irrelevant outside of google. - if forced to choose, you would prefer a high salary, incredible benefits and job stability more than working on projects you care about. There are relatively few Pros that survived my first 2 months here and that I&#039;ll miss when I leave. These are : - you are surrounded by smart, interesting people many of whom are new to the area and looking to make friends. - some really awesome internally-built tools for writing code, doing code reviews, building dashboards, etc.</p> review1666: Easy work schedule. Work/life balance easy. You&#039;re doing something you love.</p> review1667: Work at Google, change the world.</p> review1668: Never a dull moment, always something new to work on, great camaraderie among co-workers, great perks, meaningful work, room for growth and job diversification</p> review1669: treats employees well does cool stuff free food and other things pays well</p> review1670: Everything was spectacular loved it!</p> review1671: Good intern program. Nice people.</p> review1672: -Challenging -Smartest people to work with -Changing the world</p> review1673: Challenging problems, work/life balance, the people.</p> review1674: Great people, food, and opportunities</p> review1675: * perfectly organized to take care of chores including meals and paperwork * you can focus on engineering tasks</p> review1675: great salary and benefits, health insurance for all and the ammenities around the company are suburb, great work life balance</p> review1676: good at most of time</p> review1677: The food was the only thing I liked about working here.</p> review1678: Work is hard, and there&#039;s lots of it, so it&#039;s not what I&#039;d call a &#034;cushy&#034; job, but if you&#039;re not lazy and have what it takes to pass the legendary interviews, you will likely do well. It still feels like the company is run by engineers, even though that&#039;s not really the case anymore. And yeah, there&#039;s free food (3 times a day), soda, gym membership, and so on and so forth.</p> review1679: Well, you don&#039;t have to work at Software Engineer III, you could work as Sr. Software Engineer and get even more interesting projects and influence on how they go.</p> review1680: Benefits, perks, great people, culture</p> review1681: People are very friendly here</p> review1682: Great benefits, free food, latitude to create projects that make a difference, environment of trying to change the world in a positive way</p> review1683: Fantastic people to work with</p> review1684: Great and fantastic. Nice people, great work experience, overall a great company to work for.</p> review1684: young work crowd happy atmosphere like minded people aggressive mentality chance to make it really big</p> review1685: Lots of new challenges everyday.</p> review1686: Free food, flexibility to travel, work hard play hard mentality, generally smart and considerate coworkers, open communication</p> review1687: Very nice environment for work, great people to work with, and some exciting projects. Also, very good benefits and competitive salary.</p> review1688: I doubt there is a company that treats any of their employees as well as Google does. As an employee you really feel like the company shares wealth among all their employees. The work you do here is high impact and they&#039;re very open to letting you figure out new ways to do things.</p> review1689: innovative, diverse portfolio, forward-looking, brilliant teammates, dynamic, perks</p> review1690: I was a summer intern. I got a challenging project during the summer to accomplish. The working atmosphere is free but tough. Free food is awesome.</p> review1691: Working at scale - you can have a global impact in almost any area. Getting to Think Big - Strong technical peers - highly educated, exceptionally skilled workforce.</p> review1692: free food, good pay, good people</p> review1693: Great people and culture. You have the autonomy to follow your interests and build your own career path.</p> review1693: great treatment of employees, amazing culure, smart/hardworking/dedicated employees, a chance to make a big impact</p> review1694: -Work/life balance -Career development opportunities -Support from management to pursue 20% projects</p> review1695: Awesome work life balance. Super smart people, great culture. They make the tools you need to success super accessible (info and hardware).</p> review1696: Good location, good salary and good food. I like the company and the location. The atmosphere is nice there. The interview is competitive. I do not know how many words to input.</p> review1697: Food. I think I have gained about 15 pounds since I have been here :)</p> review1698: Fantastic perks, really smart people, and a great place to get started with a career. Overall, really enjoyed my experiences there and hope the best for the company.</p> review1699: All of the amenities are great.</p> review1700: - Exciting work/work environment - Exposed to cutting edge technology - Interaction with world class engineers - Great connections within the industry</p> review1701: Good perks and learning environment</p> review1702: Free Food, Young People, Laid back atmosphere, Don&#039;t feel like you are being micromanaged.</p> review1702: free food; smart people; overall interesting projects; flexible work hours (still long hours) The benefits and salary is very good but comparing to how much you end up working is not that lucrative;</p> review1703: nothing good to say about this company. works you to death. too much back stabbing and politics</p> review1704: The single most important factor for me is that you can learn a lot here. You can meet many great people, who contributed a lot to CS in general. When you want to improve your skills in particular area, you can join the team that works on that area. Also the codebase is huge with multiple examples of great engineering. Google has some internal learning classes etc. but I didn&#039;t find it as useful as people, projects and the codebase. Another thing is the &#034;hackability&#034;. With the tools we have it&#039;s very simple to start hacking on something and you can focus on solving problems. If you have an idea that you want to try, often you can have something ready within a day or two with no frustrations coming from fighting the tools all the time.</p> review1705: Best place to work 2013</p> review1706: Perks, benefits, bonuses, pay and public perception</p> review1707: Google treats it&#039;s contractors fairly well, giving them paid holidays (after 520 hours of work), access to the free food and the gyms, along with other great perks.

An employee got transferred from NY to MV HQ and didn&#039;t got out for a month, just living on Google campus! A lot of young and bright minds to work with, they will absolutely inspire you!

Really friendly coworkers as well as supervisors made for an enjoyable experience.</p> review1813: Great technology and processes that are optimized to let you succeed. Tons to learn. Smart people who are generally friendly. Fair amount of autonomy to shape your own destiny.</p> review1814: intellectual, interesting things to work on, good pay, respectful colleagues, high prestige, decent work to life balance, managers are technically v. strong.</p> review1815: Free gourmet food, coffee and beverages, great benefits, decent salary,</p> review1816: Incredible work environment, fast pace, interesting work topics, interesting project, employee involvement, flat management structure, good benefit, incredible free food</p> review1817: Google has great technology, open culture and good colleagues at work place.</p> review1818: Sure, from the outside people always talk about the awesome benefits and perks of Google, and the fact that you are surrounded by one of the smartest people in the world, but it really boils down to one thing: this company really respect its employees and gives ownership to them. There is an immense transparency at Google I have never seen at other big companies. Employees can voice their opinion on anything at Google and senior management (and boy, we do voice our opinion). The energy, atmosphere, and ownership at Google is really addictive, and I can&#039;t see myself working for any other company in the future, even if the pay is better. I do use my 20% time and actually work on another project I feel passionately about, and when you think that we are already indulged with so many benefits and perks, they just get better and better every year.</p> review1819: Benefits, culture, compensation, coworkers, mission, products, resources.</p> review1819: Lots of smart people, and great benefits</p> review1820: good pay, nice coworkers, friendly atmosphere</p> review1821: Many interesting office locations, you can be a software engineer in Paris, Sydney, New York City, or elsewhere. Good Benefits. Reasonable compensation.</p> review1822: Lots and lots of money thrown around to bring in celebrities and authors to keep you interested; the space is very clean</p> review1823: Benefits package is outstanding, great visibility into future roadmap and plans. Built and operates as an engineering company with a solid future.</p> review1824: Great perks (many of which are available for contract workers). Wonderful communication from senior management about issues and new products Fun, with lots going on.</p> review1825: Free food, lots of fun activities going on the campus. Really awesome tools internally, and also lots of benefits and fun.</p> review1826: For lack of a better way to say it, Google is just a fun place to work. There are a lot of different personalities and the attitude of the whole place is very relaxed. The best thing, however, is that this doesn&#039;t detract from the drive that individual employees and the company&#039;s leadership have to create great products and really make life better for millions (or billions) of people. It&#039;s refreshing to go to work every day with people who are very smart but still pretty down-to-earth. Another key benefit is the fact that the company is very open in terms of sharing information with its employees. Top-secret projects are regularly shared company-wide and help employees feel that they&#039;re really engaged with the company&#039;s mission and accomplishments. Finally, for product managers specifically, the scope of the job at Google is much broader than what you might get with a similar level of experience at other large tech companies, which makes y ou feel like you&#039;re making much more of an impact.</p> review1827: Brilliant coworkers, great benefits, good food, flexible schedule.</p> review1828: Google has a fantastic engineering culture and an incredible practice of software development. Everyone in the company has something valuable to offer, and there&#039;s a lot to learn from the people and the organization.</p> review1828: -Great Benefits- food, gym, time off, good hours -Lots of opportunities for interns to sit in on meetings, get contact with higher-ups -Strong intern program in business and engineering -Can be proud to work at Google, your friends and family will recognize your achievement and looks great on a resume -Flexibility to work in different departments after a year or two with the company</p> review1829: Many Cafeterias to chose from</p> review1830: The best working environment I have ever seen. Everyone is generally a team player; everyone is very smart. The leadership will make big bets to try to make things better for the user; the internal transparency is rare and everyone shares information quite freely. The benefits are industry leading and the relative youth of the company keeps it a remarkably fun place to work.</p> review1831: More than any other workplace, Google trusts its employees. Each engineer has access to almost the entire codebase and there is very little micromanaging.</p> review1832: Working with smart people daily, amazing gourmet free food, fantastic career growth opportunities within Google. If you don&#039;t like the project you&#039;re working on, you can transfer to a different project, even to be a different &#034;type&#034; of engineer (e.g. frontend/backend/storage). I work with people who&#039;ve worked on several projects at Google. Working on projects that you genuinely believe help make the world a better place, helping users connect with each other or give them greater access to information. I like the direction Larry has taken the company, feels more focused now than before. Very pro-women, pro-LGBT, pro-minority environment. I&#039;m a female software engineer and have not seen a shred of the sexism or attitude towards women that I&#039;ve experienced at other workplaces.</p> review1833: - Sets the bar for employee perks - Work with some of the best in the industry - Develop content on projects used globally</p> review1834: The people, food, events, culture, and scale of work were all incredible. How many places provide cooking internships for employees?</p> review1835: Fun culture and people are incredibly smart and passionate about work/life Lots of free food (be careful or you&#039;ll gain the Google 15) Flexible schedule (I was able to work from home when I needed to) Any time I called or emailed a passive candidate I almost always got a response.</p> review1836: Started and worked on amazing products, which turned out to be highly successful.</p> review1837: Perks are second to none. Google provides every employee with free food freshly prepared on site each day by professional chefs. Google also provides free transportation to / from work from many areas where employees live. Google also has health care facilities on-site so that employees don&#039;t have to spend time driving to the doctor. Google employees can also pay to have their hair cut, get their oil changed, get their dry cleaning done, even get their bicycle repaired all on-site.</p> review1837: It is the best place for software engineers. You can lean a lot from smart googlers. Also, meals are free.</p> review1838: Good infrastructure. Good opportunity to work on interesting problems. Good place to learn how to be a professional software engineer for beginning engineers.</p> review1839: High concentration of smart + great people. Employees empowered to change the word in the good way. Full compensation package (base salary + bonus + stock + perks) is great and not easy to beat IMO, People who criticize it must have not done the math right and/or are performing poorly.</p> review1840: Quality of individual hires, strength of business, free cash flow which funds perks and benefits, less politics than other companies of a similar size</p> review1841: The following is related to sales operations management. You&#039;ll work with very smart people, and get a lot of support and feedback around doing your best work. Most senior managers have great knowledge, a lot of advice to offer, and value open, transparent communication. You&#039;ll likely work the hardest you&#039;ve ever worked at Google, but you&#039;ll also be greatly rewarded. Also, Google makes it very easy to work your hardest, and that&#039;s a huge bonus if you&#039;re interested in super-charging your career. Example (day in the life): take free shuttle to work; use available corp vehicles to run daytime errands; grab a hand brewed coffee and gourmet breakfast before starting work; communicate with brightest in your industry during the day; visit a tech-talk and learn something new; workout in the gym w/ a trainer before lunch; have lunch with a colleague at 1 of &gt;15 free themed cafes; grab an espresso shot from the micro-kitchen on way to your d esk; collaborate on a new project with someone in a different working group; back to your own work; quick $5 chair massage to rejuvenate; swing by tech-stop on way to grab a new mouse, before your professional desk ergonomic consultation begins; more work; grab gourmet dinner starting at 6:30; woah, it&#039;s late - time to go home; grab late (8:30) shuttle home. (I guess i&#039;ll have to do my laundry for free at work tomorrow).</p> review1842: Amazing perks, benefits and pay Interesting work and smart colleagues (middle managers are the exception). Concern for change is there, empowerment to do so unfortunately isn&#039;t given to the recruiting team.</p> review1843: Great pay, great projects, smart people to work with</p> review1844: Really smart people, great benefits, amazing level of transparency and access, people -especially at the top are really committed to &#034;getting it right&#034;</p> review1845: People, vision, willingness to take risk, open culture</p> review1846: open culture, freedom of choosing projects.</p> review1846: - Great perks (free food, shuttle, massage, everything) - Super smart people - Very interesting projects with a lot of reach</p> review1847: There is a lot of interesting work and customers with challenging problems.

This makes it a great place to work at because you get to learn from people with all sorts of talents.</p> review1850: plenty of opportunities cool technology good perks</p> review1851: The company allowed me to achieve growth and a better willingness to learn!

The bicycles are handy.</p> review1855: Smart and driven people, managers open and willing to speak with you.</p> review1855: Perfect job as noticed by press.</p> review1856: Respect engineers in decision making. A lot of mobility in moving into projects Information open to everyone and transparent process World-class peers to work with</p> review1857: A large company with well known and famous mentors.

Between on-site gyms, massage, a wide selection of health benefits, 401k and stock grants, competitive salary, and of course the free, gourmet meals, it&#039;s one of the cushiest jobs in Silicon Valley. The technical challenges are interesting, and the code base is enormous. Engineers are encouraged to fix any and all problems, on their own teams or completely separate projects. There is a lot of freedom to do anything that interests you, as long as you have time.</p> review1861: Great perks, work-life balance, little hierarchy, genuinely friendly coworkers, great place to network and meet future entrepreneurs, diverse workplace, LGBT friendly, open culture, smart coworkers.</p> review1862: Very open communication from senior management all the way down to interns Vested interest in employees and personal development (GoogleEDU) Smartest / most creative people I&#039;ve met</p> review1863: We are plied with small perks like espresso and organic vegetables.</p> review1864: Great benefits, great culture, enthusiastic team</p> review1864: See your company and maybe your work in the headlines.

You can learn a lot here. I loved working on mapreduce infrastructure, the google implementation is years ahead of any implementation (hadoop etc) and learned a lot. It was incredibly easy to find a job after I left Google, my experience was valued very much by other companies. Until very recent times Google was the best place to work on new innovative projects in any area from information retrieval and natural language processing to large scale distributed system. The infrastructure of datacenters is very impressive, very few companies can give you similar resources. It&#039;s up to employee to decide how much time he spends in his office and how much time he works from home. Food is free and many other benefits are available.</p> review1935: great place to work but need to have more pay for the work they give</p> review1936: stock is doing well so i am happy</p> review1936: Google has one of the best company environments I&#039;ve ever worked in.

You&#039;ll be given considerable responsibility, and paid accordingly with some pretty terrific perks.</p> review1940: Excellent compensation and benefits, including very generous match for charitable donations.</p> review1941: Google is a wonderful place to work. New York office is fantastic and I love my team. I encourage everyone to apply.</p> review1942: - Relaxed yet professional working set up - Opportunity for learning and professional growth - Excellent food - Good salary and healthy competition - Very helpful colleagues</p> review1943: Google is a good place to work.</p> review1944: Innovative, unique culture - highly collaborative and relatively transparent community.</p> review1945: Easy work, lots of random cool projects to work on. Get to multitask on tons of projects at the same time. Good location.</p> review1945: - Peers are sheer geniuses in their realm, very low amount of low performers - Fun - Great Start for college grads - pace is fast, learning is fast - AWESOME annual bonus</p> review1946: Free Food, Easy work hours</p> review1947: Great company to work for</p> review1948: Google is still a great place to go out and have an impact as an individual engineer and to have a chance to work with other awesome engineers. Management regularly makes it clear how important the individual contributor is to the company, and routinely solicits options and ideas from across the company. There has been a lot of work on addressing past weakness with career development through more manager training, more developed mentorship programs, and more talks / transparency on the performance review process. This has been part of a trend in the company to stay aware of what issues are concerning employees across the board and attempt to fix them.</p> review1949: It is a very good company to work for. They provide great benefits and treat their employees well.</p> review1950: One of the top 10 companies in America to work for according to Fortune magazine. Its one of the best experiences that I have ever had.</p> review1951: projects have high visibility &amp; impact work with very intelligent colleagues employees are well catered to</p> review1952: great side benefits, free food, nice setting for a corporation. Some of the people were nice to work with, young atmosphere</p> review1953: Google takes care of almost all of your needs, from computer and ergo equipment to a ride to work, a rental car when you need it for an errand, and tons of free food. They do a great job at trying to remove any worries about life so you can focus on your job.</p> review1954: Abililty to have high impact. Terrific benefits / compensation. Brilliant co-workers.</p> review1954: Great community and a great place to work. The benefits are top notch and the managers seem to generally care about the career future of their employees.</p> review1955: Google has a good reputation, so it looks good on a resume.</p> review1956: Great work environment, smart people, unlimited toys and food. Freedom, no nickle-and-dime mentality. Additionally, the word &#034;Google&#034; looks REALLY GOOD on a resume.</p> review1957: Brilliant employees that are remarkably able to solve complex problems, especially in engineering. Wonderful perks and healthy work / life balance.</p> review1958: amazing opportunities to educate yourself and deal with the leading edge issues of our time</p> review1959: i worked as a temp position for google and the only good thing was that the hours were consistent and the pay was decent.</p> review1960: Smart &amp; motivated colleagues, challenging technical problems, working on things millions (and millions) of people use, good culture and company values.</p> review1961: Great people, flexible work schedule, and great benefit.</p> review1962: Salary, diversity, job appreciation, culture, and lifestyle.</p> review1963: All of the things you&#039;ve already read about: Food, Dogs, 401k. Looks great on a resume: When you&#039;re ready to move on in your career, having Google on your resume in any context almost guarantees an initial interview just because folks are curious about Google and why you would ever want to leave.</p> review1963: The food was great. The place was fun to work. The people are capable and smart.</p> review1964: Open environment Flexible work hours Good for your career development in the near future</p> review1965: Great perks, fun atmosphere, access to unlimited resources</p> review1966: Delicious, healthy gourmet meals - for free Intelligent, hard-working co-workers who are all such interesting people with incredible talents beyond their work Great balance - you can learn and play at work and mgmt supports this Lots of career opportunities Good resume builder</p> review1967: The people are the best reason to work here. I had yet to meet anyone that I would consider incompetent.</p> review1968: - Great array of internal learning resources. - Great internship program, a lot of interns for all over the world. - Great place to meet other smart people and make new friends. - Great food, and there are many fun events throughout the summer.</p> review1969: It has the most free and relaxing environment among IT companies. Let alone the competitive salary and yummy food.</p> review1970: Overall an ok place to work. Good food, smart co workers. Fairly interesting work, though not always. Upper management is very transparent and open.</p> review1971: highly recommended for college graduates. this is a place you got to work for.</p> review1972: Having been at Google longer than 9 out of 10 employees, I still feel the business poses me with fresh challenges and terrific learning opportunities virtually every day. I have been able to pursue several distinct &#034;mini-careers&#034; at the company, with promotions and transfers available as I hit major project milestones. The career environment is ideal for someone who thrives on complexity, who takes initiative, and who communicates well and constantly with technical collaborators. I feel that management empowers and facilitates individual contributors. You have a fantastic liberty here to challenge how things are done (whether bureaucratically, technically or in product design). Expect fast and constant change. You can step up and drive that change, too, if you have the chops -- the courage to express a coherent vision, and the stamina and depth of skill to follow through. A high impact project at Google can affect a global user base of hundreds of millio ns (or is it billions now?), and can shape the course and direction of whole industries. You can provide great benefit to users worldwide. The right answer to a search query can literally save a life, reorient a career, or enrich a relationship. And while search is critically important, we do so much more. When it works, it is a total jazz. When it doesn&#039;t work, well, you fail fast and try something new. Everyone outside tends to ask, &#034;What company will be the next Google?&#034;, but internally we remain quite ambitious: &#034;My project at Google will be the next Google!&#034; The people here are great to work with. Passionate about ideas, compassionate toward others, with many innovative superstars, and a culture that celebrates diversity. Of course, there is some politics, human nature and fallibility -- as you will find anywhere -- but I find the overall environment positive and well intentioned.</p> review1972: * World-class, brilliant coworkers * Excellent benefits and physical environment * Above-average total compensation compared to other local companies * Some groups do very cutting-edge work</p> review1973: Total compensation is very good. Benefits are good, too. Free food, drinks, and stuff. Very flexible work environment. Flat hierarchy of management. Huge codebases to start with. Good for software engineers to develop skills. Good to put on resume.</p> review1974: workinng on new products with break thru in tech in all the areas of s/w dev in the feild of comp sc</p> review1975: There is no finer collection of engineering talent on the planet. Good perks, great free food. Fantastic talks from visiting speakers.</p> review1976: obvious perks like food, gym, celebrity visits/talks, laundry, dogs on campus, etc</p> review1977: Energetic, passionate talent pool; way above average perks &amp; benefits; fair compensation for young workforce; Having bragging rights about working for the best place in the US</p> review1978: I think most ppl r proud of working for Google. I was too...at least for the beginning of two months. So, I don&#039;t need to repeat the good things about working for Google here. But, remember, all the good things are mostly posted by &#034;software engineers&#034;. They are like king of the world in Google versus operation engineers (including me) are like slavers of the king.</p> review1979: - great benefits and 401K match - great food - half-naked cuties play beach volleyball on campus - really intelligent coworkers - fascinating industry and company profile</p> review1980: People are smart and well-intentioned Gourmet food everyday, in lots of different cafes Countless opportunities to take on-campus classes Internally transparent company, even around product development</p> review1981: Good benefits Smart peers Great resume builder Relevant experience</p> review1981: 1. Work with all kinds of smartest people in the world. 2. Good pay 3. Never get bored. 4. Free food~</p> review1982: -Challenging work everyday. -Great coworkers. -Great benifits. -Good pay. - Nice brand. You get a chance to change the world! - Its google!</p> review1983: Great and smart people to work with Good atmosphere Great perks</p> review1984: Google is a great place to work. Free meals, fun offsites, and hands off management.</p> review1985: Plenty of self-directed time and energy. Great visibility into several core tech markets. World class computing infrastructure.</p> review1986: You&#039;re working with top people in the world, the culture is very very relaxed, flex time, great benefits, free food.</p> review1987: free breakfast lunch, dinner, gym membership, social events, and shuttle to work smart and interesting co workers good name recognition</p> review1988: Open, creative atmosphere. Smart people to work with.</p> review1989: - awesome benefits - great 401k match - By far some of the smartest people - Work on interesting issues and projects - Great environment</p> review1990: - The smartest people I&#039;ve ever worked with - Fantastic benefits and access to resources needed - Never stop learning from others - Open culture, people openly share knowledge, very few secrets relative to other companies</p> review1990: The culture - Google has an amazing culture and is a very engineering centric organization. They pretty much defined how the modern silicon valley company should look like and they still do it very well. The learning opportunities - It&#039;s possible to move easily between teams at Google and you can learn a lot of about a lot of things. The perks - Everyone&#039;s heard of the perks, and they are awesome. The food is great, the benefits are great, the salaries are competitive with bonuses and stock options.</p> review1991: The people are the best reason to work for Google. Everyone is smart and brings their A game. The team culture is great if that&#039;s how you like to work, but tough if not. It&#039;s a very collaborative environment. It&#039;s filled with smart people who have personality (at least in sales). The food is outrageously good.</p> review1992: Perks, benefits, good name to have on your resume, exposure to cool tech.</p> review1993: - The environment is casual yet competitive. - You get an opportunity to work with smart people and work on great technology</p> review1994: Smart co-workers, free food, fun work atmosphere</p> review1995: Things move fast. People are competent and are among the best in their areas of expertise. There is a feeling of respect towards all the employees. The benefits are great. The hours are very reasonable.</p> review1996: great environment, recognition, felt great to work with genius</p> review1997: good company, nice coworkers, good food</p> review1998: People are smart and very friendly, the perks are unbeatable, the pay is fair for corporate world, and there are always new interesting things going on.</p> review1999: High salary, promissing company, work environment is good</p> review1999: The perks are just amazing. Their health plan is especially very generous. The people are incredibly smart and excited about their projects.</p> review2000: great place to work and co-workers friendly</p> review2001: Smart people, great infrastructure, cool products, vision clarity. Overal I was satisfied working in the company. People were always helpful and excited about talking on new things.</p> review2002: Great, engineer-driven company. Groups are all very autonomous, so individual engineers have a lot of control over direction of the group and responsibility for the success of the team. The company assumes you&#039;re going to be thinking about more than getting to your current milestone, and expects you to think big and aim for large goals. I&#039;ve found the other engineers sharper and more accomplished than anywhere else; everyone has shipped great things before, and they&#039;re eager to do it again. It&#039;s not surprising to be working with a 24 year old who sold a company, two senior engineers who were VPs at startups, and a well-known researcher in a particular area.</p> review2003: learning,networking,growth,money, perks and other benefits</p> review2004: people senior managment career progression pay hours learning curve market leader lots of opportunities to take on more responsibility fun atmosphere young</p> review2005: Decent Pay, Relaxed Atmosphere, good work mates good hours</p> review2006: - Lot of transparency for a company of its size - Super smart co-workers - Outstanding benefits, at least in the Mountain View office. - Innovation in several areas of technology. Not afraid to stand up to big telecom/government etc. in the interest of the common good.</p> review2007: The benefits are nice, though less extravagant in offices that don&#039;t have engineers. The people are for the most part bright, friendly, and really willing to help each other. The work is interesting and rarely boring.</p> review2008: Best food ever as well as a very helpful group of people to work with. They definitely care about how you feel at all times.</p> review2008: -Great food -Internal transparency when it comes to what projects are being worked on (not transparent on things like promotions) -Lots of stuff going on -Always changing -Fun people -Great location in NYC -Speakers and authors visit Google--great perk! -Concierge team helps arrange discounts, etc. -In-house massage (I will miss that!) -Good for the resume -Great place to meet future start-up partners. Cool techie environment. Learn the latest and greatest in the tech world as it develops.</p> review2009: + Outstanding, A+ engineering talent + Founders really push teams to &#034;think big&#034; and change the world + Engineers have great freedom to choose what they work on + Eng SVP&#039;s great.. technically and as leaders.. love them all. + Great place for recent grads</p> review2010: Perks, lots of smart people to work with</p> review2011: Great work environment Willing to take risks Failure is not a problem, just don&#039;t fail over and over in the same way</p> review2012: My 2 main criteria for working at a company are 1. that there are smart people to work with and 2. that there are interesting things to work on. Google excels at both of these traits and I&#039;ve been completely satisfied all of the years I&#039;ve worked there. The free food and abundance of other benefits aren&#039;t so bad either.</p> review2013: +Very collegial culture +Awesome perks +Great place to work if you find the right team/manager combination +Lots of flexibility in how you want to design your objectives and do your job</p> review2014: Many smart people, very challenging problems, good perks, excellent benefits, very good free food, good cash bonuses and engineering ladder promotions for personal achievements</p> review2015: There are many things said about working for Google, so it makes no sense to reiterate them, but yes the perks are great and the compensation is competitive, and there are very few places that are that much fun to work at! What makes working for Google special is the projects you&#039;re working on, instead of re-implementing old concepts you can spend your time on working on new concepts that haven&#039;t been done before, if you&#039;re passionate about changing the world this is the place to do it at. And the people you work with are just as great, incredibly smart and motivated and a real pleasure and inspiration to work with. In the end, isn&#039;t that what&#039;s most important? Feeling that you&#039;re making a difference and doing something useful, and doing it with people you enjoy working with.</p> review2016: what can you say...i luv it here...the food, the fun, the smarts, it&#039;s a great place to work and one that all my friends want to join</p> review2017: Free Food Perks (Massages, Onsite Laundry, Dry Cleaning Service) Bonus Plan/Compensation Annual Trips Flexibility to work from home Working with some of the smartest people in technology!!</p> review2017: - Great colleagues, very smart people</p> review2018: Yes, the food is great and the 401k match is amazing. The base compensation is not top of market. I&#039;d say it&#039;s average at best, but what really makes up for it are the bonuses, bonus multipliers and stock grants, which you get EVERY YEAR. That&#039;s right, EVERY YEAR you get more shares, not options, shares of stock which are currently above $550 each. Bonus multipliers when the company does well are nice. Everyone in the company got a bonus last quarter just because the company beat its own expectations. What has made Google really great are the brilliant minds that work there. Best machine learning people on the planet. Creator of the Python programming language. One of the authors of C. There are so many brilliant people at Google, and yet, the pecking order is pretty flat. When you start, you&#039;ll enter your Noogler class and be immediately overwhelmed since your class will have the top guys from Yahoo, IBM, Oracle and so forth with the same titl e as you - you&#039;ll wonder if you belong. Everybody you meet at Google will have been the best, most talented person at their previous organization. Somehow, Google has managed to preserve an open culture where people really aren&#039;t arrogant. I don&#039;t know where this &#034;arrogant Google engineer&#034; stereotype came from, because this is about as far from the truth as it gets. You will learn so many secrets it will blow your mind. The tools you have available are mind blowing. You get to dogfood and have your applications dogfooded internally long before they are released. 20% time exists! In reality it&#039;s never as sexy as working on Gmail, but if you have a passion, say, writing a MySQL client in Go, the new language Google released, go for it. Google engineers can take time to attend classes to improve themselves. Google invests a lot of money in career development for their employees. There&#039;s too much good stuff going on at Google to put down. I&#03 9;m sure some of the other reviews will cover them.</p> review2019: (1) awesome technologiy (2) Wonderful coworkers (3) Very open and encouraging work environment (4) Last but certainly not least, the great food.</p> review2020: Great infrastructure, smart senior managers,great benefits</p> review2021: Great perks, good atmosphere, challenging problems, very employee friendly, peer driven reviews, good food, deadline driven, competitive compensation</p> review2022: Good name in your resume, but less opportunity since it is a huge companies now. Further, it is up to the team you are working on and the managers. The management structure is kind of mess. But it is full of tenants who you can learn from.</p> review2023: You will interact with one of the most brilliant computer science workers Free food, free beer, shuttles, opportunity to shake hands with Obama and all the glitz. Sunny state, beautiful campus, I even do my laundry there some days</p> review2024: -Free food is great -Great learning opportunity</p> review2025: Tons of career development, transparency, benefits, intelligent coworkers, exciting industry to be engaged in. Relaxed, casual and fun atmosphere. Lots of side projects that you can dip your toes in.</p> review2026: * Great Co-workers. My experience has been overwhelmingly positive in this area. My co-workers are smart, motivated, and trustworthy. I can count on them for design and execution. * Great products. Loving the product you work on is great motivation for getting up in the morning. * Engineer-oriented. Product managers for the most part do not call the shots. Engineering bears most of the responsibility for design, timelines, etc. * Flexible hours. Performance really is king; engineers have a lot of flexibility in deciding when to come in and leave. * Food. Delicious. * Idealism. &#034;Don&#039;t be evil&#034; isn&#039;t just some marketing ploy that insiders scoff at. There&#039;s a real culture of accountability. * Stability. I heard of no one in engineering that was worried about their job due to the global economic crisis. * Scale. You&#039;re probably working on something millions of people use. There&#039;s great job satisfaction in that.</p> review2026: *Perks *Brand Name on CV *Has long-term potential if it can become a real company and not a startup anymore *Some really smart people can be found</p> review2027: great benefits amazing people to work with wonderful work environment amazing food! innovative work environment</p> review2028: The benefits package is amazing, even if you&#039;re just a temp. Fun atmosphere, always a lot of perks, even if the job itself is boring. Coworkers tend to be friendly peers rather than smarmy corporate types, although there&#039;s a lot of corporate lingo around.</p> review2029: I worked here as a technical sourcer on a 1 year contract. Overall, the company is great - not much to complain about when you&#039;re getting fed 3 free awesome meals a day + unlimited sushi/smoothie/snacks inbetween. i loved how they allowed you to bring pet dogs to work. love the on site massage, oil changes, author talks, volleyball, etc.</p> review2030: -Lots of cool people -Lots of perks -Lots of respect from business schools/grad schools -Really chill place to work !</p> review2031: the perks ad name recognition are second to none</p> review2032: Excellent benefits Exciting company atmosphere. Who doesn&#039;t like working for a company that is frequently in media headlines Intelligent colleagues you can learn from</p> review2033: Management follows the model of the open source community, the attitude of everyone is very open. There are many well-known extras. You&#039;re working with people at the top of their game.</p> review2034: Good food, good perks, fun smart people.</p> review2035: Big problems, big resources, top-notch co-workers.</p> review2035: - Great perks, from free food from &gt;10 cafes, gym, flexible timings - Amazing people to work with, some of the smartest people i know - Its Google! - Lots of opportunities to learn and increase your skill set</p> review2036: Google is a great place for a computer scientist. There are large problems that need to be solved at enormous scale. Engineers are treated with huge amounts of respect and are listened to in regard to improving productivity and removing redtape. Google has great benefits like free food. I&#039;ve forgotten how to make my own lunch.</p> review2037: Code base. Data mining. Datacenters. Employee expertise. Openness. Food. flexibility Perks Global position</p> review2038: - Smart people - Great technology - Engineering driven - Huge impact on the world - Profitable and financially stable - Perks</p> review2039: Was a remote job. All web based. Nice on the resume. Very few requirements other than languages speaking and search knowledge.</p> review2040: The many perks including free gourmet food, snacks galore, cultural events, speakers/authors, lots of smart people from all over the world to meet and work with. Many choices of projects to work on and relative freedom to do so. There is plenty of work to do here from improving existing systems and creating new products. Kid in a candy store if you are eager and driven to make things better. Wide range of technologies - handhelds, operating systems, HTML5, Linux, file systems, compilers.</p> review2041: It is much easier to work at Google as a contractor. The interview process was compressed to one phone screen and a 3 one-hour interviews on-site. The team I worked with was very supportive, and gave us a lot of flexibility and discretion in how we completed the tasks.</p> review2042: Innovative products/projects, intelligent people, brand/company recognition, compensation</p> review2043: Highly recommend it! Entrusted with a lot of responsibility.</p> review2044: The swag, food, and pride of working for a profitable company are definitely worth the problems that the company faces.</p> review2044: The work and projects are very challenging; Google&#039;s products have wide visibility; great food and perks, and working for Google is great for your resume. Google rewards their top performers well. Base salary tends to run at around the 50th percentile in the industry, but annual bonuses the last few years have been ~25% of salary (it&#039;s not uncommon for above average performers to receive bonuses of 25-35% of salary). Google also matches 401K contributions up to $8,250 for U.S. workers. BTW, 401K matching is something I really wished Glassdoor keeps data on. When comparing overall compensation of two or more companies, you have to account for 401K matching.</p> review2045: There are few places where your work can have the same impact it will have at Google. Your products touch millions of people, and millions or billions in revenue.</p> review2046: - Good food - Good perk - Smart people - Fun culture - Good reputation. Great to have on a resume</p> review2047: Google has a bunch of smart people. Also, there is a strong culture from old-timers to question the status quo and make this drastically better. It&#039;s also great pedigree for a resume. Pay is pretty good compared to other companies, the perks too. The shuttle service is great if you live in SF.</p> review2048: Good perks. There&#039;s a lot of smart people that work here. If you&#039;re a geek like me, then you&#039;ve found your home.</p> review2049: Google is like Disneyland for geeks. It&#039;s an incredibly great place to work: the food, the people, the projects, the opportunities...</p> review2050: Google has a tremendous brand equity, incredibly brilliant colleagues, and it has a culture that truly fosters innovation. The work environment is generally fun and challenging environment.</p> review2051: I like Google for it&#039;s transparent culture, free food and other perks (well, but those are baked in the total compensation package anyway).</p> review2052: Great place to work, cutting edge industry, excellent online marketing training</p> review2053: Smart co-workers Great food Interesting, high-impact projects Many learning opportunities High pay Good benefits 30 inch monitor Seemingly unlimited computing resources</p> review2053: I was amongst some of the most hard driven and motivated co-workers while at Google. I had very little to complain about, being surrounded by some of the brightest and most interesting people I have ever met. The team and the atmosphere made for a great work environment, the perks helped but it was more knowing you were all part of a team and accomplishing great things. Senior management wanted to help you and would give you the tools to succeed.</p> review2054: Smart people, interesting projects. I have never worked at a place where such open discussions are encouraged. Negative and positive feedback are equally welcomed.</p> review2055: The perks are great as you probably already know. Who can complain about free gourmet food and lots of freebies. But even over the last few years the company&#039;s growth has caused many of these once great perks to go downhill (but don&#039;t get me wrong the food is amazing). There are so many smart people at Google so if you want a place to learn and find out anything you&#039;ve ever wanted to know, this is the place for you. People are typically very willing to give you a helping hand any time you have a question. Google also does wonders on your resume of course.</p> review2056: ITs a great place to work and expand your knowledge. You will love the people and location is great. Dont hesitate to apply</p> review2057: The food is great and Google offers learning opportunities and personal growth.</p> review2058: The perks at Google are really cool. The free food and Google wear are all good. But the recognition of working at a cool company is a reward itself too</p> review2059: Google is a place that respects their employees.</p> review2060: Overall good smart people working together in a very open atmosphere where information sharing is highly encouraged and easy to do. Very open communication from management compared to most companies. Best total compensation I&#039;ve had at any company. Great fringe benefits like the free food, author talks, and political candidates dropping in.</p> review2061: Google offers a great environment where you are constantly challenged and pushed do to more with less. The people are brilliant and you can&#039;t beat the social environment and the perks. The culture is very open and transparent at all levels within the organization which is a lesson that other companies should learn from. The transparency truly creates an environment where everyone can share and learn.</p> review2062: * Opportunity to work with the smartest people ever. Having collaborated (to varying degrees) with quite a few Googlers, I can certainly say Googlers are &#034;la creme de la creme&#034;. * Not only they&#039;re smart, but they&#039;re dedicated 120% to their work. (The 20% is for the weekends...) &#034;Great is not good enough&#034; for each and every Googler. * Fantastic development tools (Code Search, the code review tool, the versioning tool, and N others); * Opportunity to work on products that will be used (directly or indirectly) by millions of people * Amazing code base, superbly structured, continuously optimized, all at your fingertips. * Free great food :-)</p> review2062: Benefits of course. Free food, free transportation, gyms. The people are all great people to work with. They are people I would have chosen as friends - I just didn&#039;t have to look far for them.</p> review2063: - Perks - People - Opportunities</p> review2064: The perks, food and transportation being the main ones, but there are lots of things that make it a geek&#039;s paradise if you&#039;re into that sort of thing - games everywhere, free tickets and shuttles for some movies when they open (Transformers was one), etc. Let&#039;s face it, it looks good on your resume. The chance to meet some very bright and interesting people. There are so many opportunities to educate yourself about the world through your employer - everything from tech talks on a variety of technical topics to visits by politicians and public figures. It&#039;s cool to be on the inside and learn about new products everyone else will be talking about soon.</p> review2065: - good benefits &amp; good salaries. Google treats its engineers very well, even in these economic times - very smart people, world class engineers (quality varies from group to group, though) that make very fun co-workers whether to discuss life, politics, or engineering - big impact. You know the stuff you build can affect, positively or negatively, millions of users</p> review2066: Your colleagues are smart, motivated, inventive, and helpful. If you work on the right teams, you can pick up a ton of useful knowledge in a short period of time from world-class experts. The company is attacking plenty of exciting technical problems: machine translation, huge distributed systems, creating smooth AJAX UIs, large-scale machine learning in search &amp; ads, creating a mobile phone OS from the ground up. Again, depends on what team you&#039;re on, but there&#039;s no excuse to be bored with the technical challenges. Parts of the company (e.g., Chrome, Android, mobile apps like Latitude) are blazing new ground and still feel like a start-up; in those areas, there are opportunities for entrepreneurial engineers to make a big impact (although this can be a struggle). Food is excellent.</p> review2067: Great work environment. Especially software engineers are highly enabled and valued within the company. Many different products to work on. Lots of smart people. Great benefits and free food.</p> review2068: Great benefits, working at a company everyone respects and says &#034;wow&#034; to, getting to help build the products that really are changing the world. The hours are reasonable, you are treated as a human being and respected as an engineer, and the on-site breakfast lunch and dinner are unmatched anywhere. Luckily google makes their billions using only a small fraction of their total workforce, leaving lots of capital available to dedicate resources to other projects that aren&#039;t purely motivated by short-term profits (but rather those that help build press for the organization and are theoretically interesting and innovative at the same time). Tech-talks about a whole range of topics not strictly required for you to carry out your job responsibilities but just for your general education are a huge plus. Google employs some of the most innovative thinkers and builders of our time.</p> review2069: the food is really amazing. i love this place. PIC and Lunchbox are the best cafes at the crittenden campus. a a a a a a a a a a a a a.</p> review2070: It&#039;s a company with a conscience, and the dilbert-esque moments are rarer than at other companies. Plus the food is *amazing* (at least in the larger offices)</p> review2071: They have amazing benefits and perks. The culture in some offices is very positive and fun. They allow honor system style time off for sickness as long as it is not abused. They have a large pool of talent and they look great on a resume.</p> review2071: Culture - there really are amazing people working at Google and the culture seems to have been deliberately created to make a stimulating, team-oriented environment. Benefits - the benefits are top notch from free meals, to stocked up snack rooms, to excellent 401k matching and flexibility as far as work-life balance. As the company&#039;s matured over the last few years, some of the more extravagant things are getting cut out however.</p> review2072: I worked doing QA for Google in a part-time telecommuting position. It was great because the work was interesting and I could work the hours I chose, any time of the day or night. Because I was strictly a telecommuter, I had no added expenses for gas or business work clothing.</p> review2073: You work with really smart and down-to-earth technical people on projects that have direct and visible impact to the world.</p> review2074: Google is leader on web search and has the best web search infrastructure. It is convenient for engineers to work on a single company-wide code base with same coding standard. Company reissues employee stock option to $308 recently. Bigger percentage of annual bonus compare to other companies I know of; $8000 per year 401k match; free meal and other perks. Company has the perception of being an innovative company. Friday TGIF with beer and wine. Engineers’ qualities are general fine. Many satellite offices so people don’t always have to relocate. For the first one or two years, you will be excited to explore the infrastructures, tools, systems and dream about a career path.</p> review2075: Good coworkers, sane management by and large.</p> review2076: The People. The reason Google is such a great place to work at is because of the people. There are very few places in the professional world where you&#039;ll work with people who are all bright, educated, and passionate.</p> review2077: Smart people, challenging problems, large impact. Compensation and benefits are very good. Internal tools and systems are also very good.</p> review2078: alot of smart people. Every person I meet in google is smart. Lots of perks. Basically everything you need to live at google (which can be a bad thing).</p> review2079: Super smart people. Awesome benefits. Great culture. Massive resources and infrastructure. Having worked at Microsoft and other tech companies, I can say this is the best place I&#039;ve worked at ever. The relative lack of red tape and ability for small groups of people to make things happen without dealing with too many execs.</p> review2080: Low risk work place and leader in the space. CEO is one of the best and well respected. Great place to start right out of school.</p> review2080: Working on world-class problems can be incredibly rewarding. The staff is incredibly intelligent and you&#039;ll find yourself learning a lot. Even though perks are being cut back, they are still much better than others. Middle managers don&#039;t micromanage, so you get to work mostly on your own. This may be a negative or positive, depending on your attitude to work.</p> review2081: food and people are great</p> review2082: environment is good, colleagues are great</p> review2083: This is a casual and smart environment, with a lot of great benefits. There is never an opportunity to be bored, and the company seems to encourage long hours by providing a great workplace with gaming rooms and napping areas, as well as gourmet meals thrice daily.</p> review2084: The people are the best!</p> review2085: Google is where you can put your academic toy grad school projects behind you and build real systems with serious resources behind them. You work with really sharp coworkers on projects that can impact millions of people all over the world. If you&#039;re self-directed and curious, you&#039;ll find no end of interesting problems to work on. Compensation seems reasonably aggressive in rewarding high performers.</p> review2086: My time at Google was one of the most positive experiences I&#039;ve had in my career. I was with the company at a time of rapid growth, and the skills I developed in that fast-paced environment are skills that I&#039;ll carry with me for the rest of my life. The people that I worked with at Google are some of the brightest and talented individuals I have had the pleasure to meet. I had heard that the compensation and benefit package they offer their employee&#039;s was legendary, and when I joined the company it didn&#039;t disappoint. Google is doing some very cool things, and will have an immense impact on all of our daily lives for many years to come. They truly are changing the world.</p> review2087: Working with and learning from some of the most brilliant engineers in your field. Tech talks, visiting speakers, classes, etc. give you lots of opportunities to learn about a myriad of subjects. Working on some of the most interesting and innovative projects in the world. Excellent senior management.</p> review2088: Google is a great place to work if you want to be surrounded by smart and talented people. Employees have a lot of freedom, and the benefits are great. There&#039;s free food , free laundry, and even a gym. Your coworkers will be very intelligent. You are also given good training and the schedule is flexible. The pay is also very good.</p> review2089: Challenging work, perks, enlightened senior management</p> review2089: Awesome environment with smart people. Love the campus, the free food, the gym, the bikes, the perks, the massage, the 401k match, the shuttle service, etc... Love the tech talks, author series, children&#039;s center. Openness and transparency with the management team is very useful to understand what&#039;s going on with the company. Lots of exciting products are being developed and Google is leading the way in which the internet, collaboration, and mobile applications are being used. The Children&#039;s Center is an awesome place for the kids and the majority of teachers are very experienced and knowledgeable about how kids learn and develop.</p> review2090: The people. Internal opportunities to advance. Flexibility.</p> review2091: work with smart people in IT</p> review2092: The very best reason to work at Google can be summed up in one word: culture. Since that is a rather vague term, let me elaborate. Google has established and continues to nurture a culture that fosters, high levels of both work satisfaction and contribution from its employees. It does this by recognizing the potential in all employees via established work policies, rather than just through lip service, like many companies. Following are some concrete examples of this: Promotion and work performances is entirely reliant on peer reviews. In other words, to get ahead at Google and to get a positive performance review, you must get positive reviews from your fellow co-workers. Your manager might love you, but if your co-workers don&#039;t like you, you have some work to do. Managers are also required to seek peer review from those they manage. (I have never seen this before in my career.) Senior level employees from other fields are also encouraged to seek peer review s from people in other departments. For example, engineers need reviews from people other than engineers in order to advance. For this reason, a culture of cooperation is endemic at Google. This is great because the percentage of &#034;cowboys&#034; that seems common at other high tech companies is quite low at Google. It also fosters an awareness of the type of contribution made by people outside your department, since everyone reviews people in other fields, and therefore must learn a bit about what others do outside their sphere. Career tracks fall into either management or individual contributor. This is great for people who might want to try management but later decide that they perform best as an individual contributor, or who just want to take a break from management for a while. In addition, it&#039;s not too difficult to switch between tracks. Finally, managers and team leads are also encouraged to solicit leadership-level contribution from the reportees, as a way t o encourage career growth and to share the load, so to speak. This whole mechanism results in a very strong sense of independence and high-level of function from everyone, because if there is a problem that you think should be fixed, you can fix it and get genuine recognition for it, both from peers and managers. You are required to keep a work log, as a means for you to accurately report on your contributions and as a source for your own assessment and of others&#039; assessment of you. In addition, there are other assessment tools that are big part of Google work life, designed to keep you mindful of your work contribution and to help you and others write performance reviews. This sort of sounds tough, but the end result is that you can work to your best and not have to worry about mis-perceptions of your performance: you&#039;ve written it down. Additionally, if you are spending a LOT of time working on tasks not related to your main project, your log is a way for you to  work with your manager in order to change unnecessary demands on your time. I would say that this practice exemplifies one portion of the transparency that is so pervasive at Google. Ideas and contributions from employees are highly encouraged. This results in some great products for the company, like AdWords, which was an idea from an early Google engineer, and Gmail, which was a 20% project. Googlers also gain a lot of company and community recognition for extra efforts/contributions that they feel passionate about, and this only adds to the environment for everyone. As another example, some employees at Google Mountain View worked hard to create alternative means of fresh drinking water for employees, rather than having the company stock water bottles (which contribute tremendously to landfill waste). This was a big effort. Now we have filtered water stations all over the place--it&#039;s not directly tied to &#034;search&#034; but it contributed to the company mission to  &#034;do no evil&#034; and it added to the green image of the company. I could go on and on about culture at Google, and I&#039;ve only scratched the surface, but hopefullly this conveys a sense of what I mean by &#034;culture&#034; at Google and how important this element is to a great working environment.</p> review2093: Great working environment. Meeting innovative engineers</p> review2094: The quality of coworkers is outstanding, though declining over time as we hire more and more MBAs with plain and boring backgrounds. The perks in terms of facilities are still quite amazing. You can&#039;t beat the lunches in Mountain View, the clear weather, and the energy if you&#039;re on the main campus (bldg 40-43). If you&#039;re on a key team, there&#039;s also ample opportunity to jet around the world and work at your own pace doing things you love.</p> review2095: When compared to most companies, Google still delivers on the hype. The benefits (food, 401K, parties, etc) are still outstanding even as the try to cut costs. The culture is still entrepreneurial with a lot of change and innovation being driven from the bottom-up and raised to management at the national level. The brand is unparalleled in the advertising, online media and technology fields and is a brand that opens doors in almost all industries. Although Google is certainly experiencing growing pains as it transitions to a large company and tries to branch out from AdWords, it still earns its reputation as a great place to work.</p> review2096: The food is great! The people are smart. There aren&#039;t a lot of stupid rules. You can wear what you want, come in when you want, hang out with really great people.</p> review2097: Forget all of the fringe crap like snacks, cafes, massages, etc. That stuff is easy come-easy go (as 2008 has shown), and once the novelty wears off, it doesn&#039;t really affect your life much. There are better reasons: Overall quality of employees is the highest I have ever seen. You won&#039;t find yourself having to dumb down your project so that the rest of the team can contribute. Google&#039;s size and wealth give you the opportunity to work on global-scale engineering problems that few other companies have. It&#039;s nice to work for a company that at least makes a pretense of not being evil.</p> review2098: Amazing people and technical challenges are two of the best reasons to work at Google. I am always astounded at the people that I work with, and the technology that I play with.</p> review2098: The hours are extremely flexible and work is completely online. This job was great because I did not have to spend any money on clothing, food or transportation. The pay is much higher than other online jobs and the work is comparable. Google is a great company and is a company that you can be proud to work for.</p> review2099: Lots of smart people. Team atmosphere where it seems like most people are making a difference. Unusual perks that lead to being a member of a family, a team.</p> review2100: A very dynamic place. There was always something going on and they really did try to take care of you.</p> review2101: The culture, the perks, the brilliance of the people around you. Google gets a glowing reputation, and much of it is justified: yes, there are massage chairs, aquaria, nap pods and free food everywhere. It has an enlightened, &#034;Star Trek&#034; sort of feeling with regards to money and advancement: people are expected to be happy working hard on the things they love without regard to title or compensation.</p> review2102: Incredible educational opportunities, regular tech talks and other information sessions. Colleagues are some of the brightest people around. There&#039;s also a certain prestige attached with working at Google and you may find your next job easier to get just having had worked there, although the culture makes it such that people straight out of college never want to leave since the perks are so good and they are pampered.</p> review2103: 1) Bright, motivated colleagues. Willingness to change and try new things. Low barriers to trying new methods. 2) Ave to High Total Compensation, particularly when benchmarked against competitors like msft, cisco, etc. (base+ind bonus_+ co bonus). Low base, balanced by other compensation. 3) Collaborative and at least, striving to be ethical, culture 4) Great perks, free gormet food, low cost massage, excellent heathcare, top 401k match, guest speakers</p> review2104: -- Google employees are very bright (all have Ivy Educations) and enjoy coming to work everyday. The general sense that I get from talking to other employees is that we all feel that we are making the world a better place.</p> review2105: Great benefits, stellar engineers, the ability to work on large, interesting problems. Company has large and usually positive effects on the world.</p> review2106: It&#039;s a fast-paced environment where employees have a good deal of flexibility on projects they want to work on. Everyone was friendly and welcoming. It seemed like there was a good work-life balance throughout the organization. One thing that was clear was that senior management significantly valued their employees and took every step to take care of them. For example, there were free breakfasts, lunches, and dinners. During the summer, we were taken on a beach trip to Santa Cruz. Overall, it was a fun work environment.</p> review2107: the perks are the reason to work at google. the food, the shuttle, the casual culture, working from home, massages, etc. Typical PMM roles include: Product launch marketing: You&#039;ll ensure that all stakeholders (such as customers and the sales team) are informed about product and feature launches. You&#039;ll conduct market research, write communications, and do release planning with engineering, product management, and the sales organization. Field marketing: You&#039;ll devise marketing strategy and provide up-to-date market research to enable a true consultative selling approach for the field sales organization. This involves a lot of interaction with the sales and product management team, creative use and presentation of market research, and the ability to create true marketing solutions for customers. Consumer product marketing: Working with one of our portfolio of consumer products (such as Froogle or Gmail), you&#039;ll devise a plan to improve customer  satisfaction or increase customer acquisition. This involves significant amounts of market research, product-usage analyses, positioning, and customer segmentation.</p> review2107: hip, people are easy going and the campus is pretty cool</p> review2108: the perks are the reason to work at google. the food, the shuttle, the casual culture, working from home, massages, etc. Typical PMM roles include: Product launch marketing: You&#039;ll ensure that all stakeholders (such as customers and the sales team) are informed about product and feature launches.

The food is very very good, as are the snacks. I&#039;m sure it doesn&#039;t hurt on your resume either. In addition, the management generally does care about your personal life...this is not a company that forces you to work 24/7.</p> review2110: By far the top reason is working with smart, competent people and the opportunity to have a big positive impact on the world. The resources and infrastructure are very nice as well. In general, Google is an engineering-centric company, and it is a great place to be a software engineer.</p> review2111: - Great technical talent - Great software engineering practices - Outstanding benefits - Lot of visibility into the inner workings of the company</p> review2112: It looks good on your resume. Additionally, everybody you speak with will recognize the company you work for, as it certainly has good name recognition. There are a lot of learning opportunities, and very intelligent people to learn from beyond the provided courses. Taking advantage of all of these resources is what makes working for this company worth doing, at least for a period of time.</p> review2113: From the moment the opportunity arose, I was thrilled to be a part of the elusive Google empire - all those free meals, riding scooters in the halls, the brightly colored offices, gym classes and casual culture. I was very proud to work for such a respected, prestigious organization - it reflects how people think of you and that never gets old...I&#039;ll never forget after telling a new friend I worked for Google he remarked &#034;well you must be someone pretty special to be working there...&#034; And I was!</p> review2114: Everyone knows they have great benefits, but apart from that they also have an amazing amount of resources, excellent process guidelines, and great information sources to improve in your work. The people are really talented, and most are willing to help you. If you land in a good group you&#039;ll have a dream job. If not, you&#039;ll be stuck in a regular job, but it will still have a lot of great things attached to it, so how is it worse or different than other jobs? The food is as great or better than what people say about it. The weather in Mountain View also helps.</p> review2115: yes most of the people who wanted to work at Google would think about all the perks they will get and yeah that&#039;s right. Google&#039;s benefits are pretty much the best so far I&#039;ve ever recieved i.e. insurance, massage, food, etc. The people here are ones of the smartest people I&#039;ve worked. Google has great products that everyone really enjoys to use.</p> review2116: One of the best reasons to work for Google is the educational opportunities it provides. On any given day, there are multiple educational events happening on campus (tech talks, author talks, poltical appearances, job-related educational seminars, etc.), and many attend while simultaneously working on their laptops. Benefits (insurance, food, on-site services) are excellent, and campus-sponsored events (holiday parties, wine tastings) are added bonuses.</p> review2116: Great people to work with. interesting problems to solve. I have met some many Googlers with a wide range of interests. People are very creative, driven and have a desire to change the world.</p> review2117: One of the best reasons to work for Google is the educational opportunities it provides. On any given day, there are multiple educational events happening on campus (tech talks, author talks, poltical appearances, job-related educational seminars, etc.), and many attend while simultaneously working on their laptops. Benefits (insurance, food, on-site services) are excellent, and campus-sponsored events (holiday parties, wine tastings) are added bonuses.</p> review2118: The food and the gym, the perks of valet parking, commuter services, taking your dog to work, oil changes while you work, hair cuts, dental appt., doctor appts, they really do a great job of making sure you are physically taken care of at work</p> review2119: Google is a great work environment. Of course, the food is wonderful. In addition, it is such a good opportunity to work with really talented people on interesting and difficult problems. There are team opportunities but also space for individual work. You can&#039;t beat the resources and access to data. There are many opportunities to build on work that others have done in order to enhance one&#039;s own work. Overall, a very interesting and exciting place to work.</p> review2120: Good working environment, good hours, great people.</p> review2121: Google is known the world over. It&#039;s probably the greatest spring board to your next big career. It&#039;s hiring screens are legendary - if you&#039;ve once worked at Google, its known that you&#039;ve passed muster at one of the most prestigious companies to work for.</p> review2122: 1. Very smart and rational co-workers/managers, most of them (even the superstars) down-to-earth and approachable. 2. Good salary and some benefits (e.g., food/drinks/outings/events), even for interns. 3. The general atmosphere is very vibrant, morale is very upbeat, and both of these contribute to productivity for sure. 4. The ability to make an impact is incredible - there is already a powerful platform with wide reach, so you are sure to have your work get a &#034;first look&#034;, sustained interest depends upon the usefulness of the contribution though. 5. Especially for interns, it is a great feeling to have your opinions heard and respected, even on critical long-term projects. 6. Diverse engineering crowd, unlike other tech. companies like Cisco and Microsoft which are Asian/Indian heavy - this is good or bad depending on your preference.</p> review2123: Food, message, offsites, endless perks. Great coworkers, interesting products and technologies.</p> review2124: flexible time to work and perks</p> review2125: Google offers a very goal-oriented and challenging work environment. The Google name on the resume opens up many doors in the software industry. I grew as a programmer at Google. The scale of the development work is virtually unmatched in the industry and that needs out-of-the box thinking. The best part of the job was working with so many smart people. I learned more from my colleagues than I did in college. I also loved free food:) The informal work culture at Google is something I truly enjoyed.</p> review2125: Free Food, shuttle, smart prople, other perks.</p> review2126: Google encompasses the dot com environment. The culture is very laid back. The perks such as free meals and snacks is nice, bringing my dog into the office is also nice. The work outings are good as well. And you get to work with some cutting-edge technology. There are a lot of bright people in the company that you can learn a lot from. It feels like working a summer job all year long.</p> review2127: Google has great respect for its employees and users; while the company makes a great deal of money, most of the people who build the products that people use on a daily basis concentrate much more (much more) on how to do something great and how to provide a service to the world. Google is internally transparent, a responsible citizen, and full of wonderfully talented people and great potential. Google employees offer innumerable benefits to one another, too, with free yoga, art classes, general interest classes, etc. being run constantly. Plus, the food and massage are fantastic.</p> review2128: Simple a great place to work. There are plenty of videos and articles about how Google is the best place to work, and it&#039;s all true.</p> review2129: -Benefits (medical, subsidized massage, food) -People (bright, high achievers) -Cool products that employees use and love -Frequent performance feedback (ratings given every quarter, 360 feedback twice a year) -Employee morale varies across teams. Has gotten lower as the company is growing older</p> review2130: Some very smart people and good benefits. All the free food and subsidized massages are good.</p> review2131: The people, the atmosphere, and the food. All 3 of these are unlikely to be duplicated anywhere else. It is an extremely jovial and cooperative atmosphere where there are bound to be experts in any topic you may want to know about. The food is awesome as well, but this is well known.</p> review2132: freedom to do things you really interested: in addition to 20% time, it is also easy to change projects, and there is no manager &#039;manage&#039; you all the time, you are on your own most of the time. good salary, bonus and benefits * great coworkers: very smart and nice people, and you can learn a lot from them. * You can sense that the management really want to treat the employees well, their target is to build a great company and serve the world, not just for profit</p> review2133: brand recognition, benefits, entereneurship opportunities</p> review2134: First and foremost, smart people. Overall I&#039;m very impressed with the level of intelligence of just about everybody I worked with. Second, huge datasets, huge scale, huge opportunities. Google is the place to be for working at scale, period. The tools are great and there are limitless computing resources. Other stuff - it&#039;s still a fun environment, flexible work hours, flexible about projects to work on.</p> review2134: Google continues to be a leader and innovator, even having become public and hit the 10 year mark. Even though the company has gotten bigger and progressively more bureaucratic (perhaps unavoidable considering its growth), I do think that at heart they really want to continue to push the envelope. My fellow Google employees were among the smartest and most creative people I&#039;ve worked with. Probably some of the most enthusiastic too. Google has a lot of money, and they are able to provide their employees with a lot of perks and benefits that other companies can&#039;t afford. Also very philanthropic. (Again, they have the money, so they can afford to be.) They are extremely forward thinking, in terms of trying projects that don&#039;t directly relate to business. It&#039;s cool to try out new products that become part of your everyday life. GMail and Google Docs among my favorites.</p> review2135: I have never met so many brilliant people at one company ever. I have worked for 8 years in industry now. Seriously, there is not a single dumb employee. -- Perks Google is the best company I have worked for as far as perks are concerned. Name a perk and Google will beat its rival. Food? Massage? Shuttle service? Nap room ? Doctor? Offsites? Beer on campus? What else?</p> review2136: There&#039;s a ton of engineering resources, and everything is pretty open and transparent within the company. Lots of on the job perks, and there are really cool projects all over the company to spend time on.</p> review2137: Smart creative dedicated colleagues; exciting and innovative work environment; open and frequent communications at every level; excellent compensation</p> review2138: You&#039;ll work with some of the smartest and most accomplished people in the industry. People truly believe they can change the way things are done. The ability to have your products make a huge impact on the industry. Constant innovation and change is part of the culture.</p> review2139: Great People, great technology! You work with the best people in the industry and work in some fascinating technologies. Google aspires to be an organization that reflects the globally diverse audience that our search engine and tools serve. We believe that in addition to hiring the best talent, the diversity of perspectives, ideas, and cultures leads to the creation of better products and services. The diversity of our employees and partners serves as the foundation for us to better serve our diverse customers and stakeholders all over the world.</p> review2140: Google has plenty of talented engineers, impressive computational infrastructure and resources, and the culture to build products that make big impacts. Working for Google is an ideal start point of young engineers or new graduates. There are plenty of challenging problems to solve, and you have the flexibility to choose the projects that interest you most. I am not saying that you can give up the current project at any time. it is responsible to finish the projects that started, but you are encouraged to switch projects every 1 to 2 years, or at least, you can do the &#034;fun&#034; things with your 20% time.</p> review2141: great coworkers; fun and interesting projects; perks and benefits; potential to have a positive effect on many users</p> review2142: The food, the smart co-workers, the overall benefits package.</p> review2143: Amazing resources available onsite. All the perks really are amazing as they say. not only is the food amazing but they also have haircuts, car washes, massages, social events, and more all available without leaving the campus. The people also are really smart and amazing. My group would go to snack (a free warm snack at 3 PM) and do brain teasers/philosophy puzzles.</p> review2143: You&#039;ll have a chance to work with a lot of talent ppl</p> review2144: The Food! Lots of events happening on a daily basis that allow you to disconnect from work. A younger demographic that&#039;s great for singles or folks who like to make close friends with their coworkers. You can come up with and run with any ideas you think are worthwhile. Not a huge amount of red tape to change process. Very easy to get international exposure because of Google&#039;s large reach across the globe.</p> review2145: The free food is good and better than what you have heard. It really rocks and I will really miss it. Also the co-workers I met were one of the brightest people (in software) around and it was charm to actually work and see what good coding is really all about. And its not just some stars - there are actually people who are really good and work together and the team as a whole contributes a lot towards the success of a product. Further the software infrastructure is the best among all the places I have seen and I have seen the better ones.</p> review2146: free food, for someone coming out of college, could be quite an incentive. not too many meetings, can get things done.</p> review2147: The prestige. What can I say--it&#039;s kinda cool the reaction it stirs when you tell people you work for Google. It&#039;s like that first time you used it, and got just the right result on the first try--very satisfying. Free food. It&#039;s great not to have to worry about feeding yourself, and the food and snacks are fantastic in New York. Smart people. If you&#039;re on the product/engineering side of things you&#039;ll work with some of the sharpest people in the industry. Most have stellar academic records and are just plain brilliant. If you&#039;re on the sales side, it&#039;s a different story, not that there are not plenty of bright, talented sales people. It&#039;s just a different kind of intelligence and not as prevalent. Cool products. It&#039;s awesome to watch the new products roll out, and to test them while they&#039;re in development.</p> review2148: Responsibility and ability to make impact early in one&#039;s career</p> review2149: Perks are phenomenal! Projects are extremely high impact. The company trusts engineers to &#034;do the right thing&#034; and prefers to give engineers information so they can make decisions instead of hording information to make the decisions themselves. Engineers get all the best tools (Big monitors, lots of computing resources) and don&#039;t have much red-tape getting normal stuff done.</p> review2150: Competent people. Enough resources to succeed. You have the chance to build products that millions of people will use, rather than worrying if you will be able to build something that anyone gets used. Management is generally in touch and cares--their opinions are sometimes wacky, but the fact that they know about every project and aren&#039;t being bamboozled by middle managers is a huge win as compared to most tech companies this size.</p> review2151: Good compensation, great benefits, great culture. Also, the fact that after working with Google, you can basically pick where you want to work next. Working on new and exciting projects (Android, etc.). Learning from the best is a great way to enhance your skills and develop professionally.</p> review2152: Free breakfast, lunch and dinner. Google is not a conventional company, and we don’t intend to become one. True, we share attributes with the world’s most successful organizations – a focus on innovation and smart business practices comes to mind – but even as we continue to grow, we’re committed to retaining a small-company feel. At Google, we know that every employee has something important to say, and that every employee is integral to our success. We provide individually-tailored compensation packages that can be comprised of competitive salary, bonus, and equity components, along with the opportunity to earn further financial bonuses and rewards.</p> review2152: Cutting-edge technology, famous brand, good food. The good weather here in mountain view, ca is also a good reason. If you are tired with the free food here, go get some decent dinners in the Castro street nearby. You can also learn a lot from tech talks, open days, the moma, and the code tree itself. Google&#039;s code base may not be the biggest, but its quality is the best in the world.</p> review2153: It was a great place to be working for straight out of college. When you start work there they really take the time to make sure that you&#039;re trained properly so that you don&#039;t feel like a fish out of water like at other companies. Benefits can&#039;t be beat. Besides the free lunches, fantastic 401k, etc, you get large bonuses fairly often. Co-workers were intelligent and great to work with for the most part. I also had a great relationship with my manager and thought I was treated fairly, but it can vary widely at Google. All in all, there&#039;s few better places to start off for a young college grad.</p> review2154: great perks.. the food at the cafeteria kept me up all night long the best and brightest engineers. Most people I am working with are very well-rounded, I feel I could learn a lot from most of them. I can contribute to products which are used by millions of people every day. I enjoy analyzing challenging problems and finding a cost effective solution. Flexible hours and relaxing working environments (including all the perks such as free meals.</p> review2155: The projects are interesting. There are interesting data sets to explore. There are cool tools to use, along with infrastructure for puttnig together new tools. The people are great--when you meet a &#034;dud&#034; at Google, it tends to stick in your memory since the duds are so rare. It&#039;s satisfying to work on a service that&#039;s helped so many people. The food is great; chefs are treated like rock stars and rightly so. The company has income; this is a pleasant change after working at other software development companies.</p> review2156: 1. Incredibly smart engineers. Most Googlers I am working with are very well-rounded, I feel I could learn a lot from most of them. 2. Big impact. I can contribute to products which are used by millions of people every day. 3. Deal with challenging problems. 4. Flexible hours and relaxing working environments (including all the perks such as free meal and message)</p> review2157: extraordinary co-employees, some of the most brilliant people on the planet. knowledge is enormous all around you. embraces a keep it simple philosophy in making products instead of a bloated overloaded features product.</p> review2158: It&#039;s a great place to work as a programmer. The tasks we work on are mostly interesting and challenging, and the breadth at which your work will be applied is nearly unparalleled, certainly in the online business. The people are fun and smart.</p> review2159: the benefits, especially the food and fluid hours, are great. so is the fact that everyone around you is incredibly smart.</p> review2160: Thanks for setting up this site Glassdoor. Google is an industry leader in many endeavors and often finds itself listened to by competitors and partners alike. I hope that does not come off as overly confident, it&#039;s a wonderful place to work. Our management and product teams are thoughtful about all of our projects. Google enjoys a solid reputation among consumers, something that is difficult to achieve, and we lead the internet industry in consumer satisfaction. It makes me proud to say I work for a company that is so highly regarded by our partners, competitors and the general public. We are a company that provides innovative answers to today and tomorrow&#039;s questions. Our technology is more powerful than our competition and we continue to add new services to our already robust product suite. We leave the end users satisfied and our partners happy that we&#039;re looking out for their best interests. There are other great reasons to work for Google, yes  there is free lunch but that is just one piece to the puzzle. It&#039;s generally the overall trust that the company has in it&#039;s employees and the respect that the employees show for the company. Management has decided not to put a cap on sick days and trusts that employees want to come to work, which we do. We want to work on the products that will change the way that people access and consume information. We want to speak to clients, collaborate with them and work with them to change the world... that&#039;s the attitude I have going into work every day for the last three years and that&#039;s a really good feeling. The best part is, Google is enabling this attitude.</p> review2161: Great, intelligent people. Lots of opportunities to work on project..and definitely the work life balance.</p> review2161: The quality of coworkers is pretty high; nearly everyone is pretty bright and fairly creative. The company is very flexible with its employees -- work matters more than hours and location. There are a number of interesting classes of problems to work on that are difficult to find elsewhere [large scale distributed systems, storage infrastructure, etc]. The potential impact of your work is huge.</p> review2162: the benefits, especially the food and fluid hours, are great. so is the fact that everyone around you is incredibly smart.</p> review2163: You interact with great developers, original thinkers and interesting people all the time. Unlimited munchies are great, three free meals a day (or two in satellite offices) is great, medical benefits, partial subsidy of fitness membership, subsidy for ongoing education (though in reality you are unlikely to have time to use it) are all pluses. Being on the winning team feels good, especially when winning an uphill battle against an entrenched monopolist.</p> review2164: The work is really challenging and interesting with a high level of independence and self direction. It&#039;s a great place for those with the drive and initiative to succeed. Employees are treated very well and the benefits are great. Managers are pretty good at encouraging work life balance and I&#039;m often told to get out of the office if I&#039;m there too late. And of course, the free food is delicious.</p> review2165: Working on the most important website on the Internet.</p> review2166: Good Benefits and Smart People</p> review2167: Great people, great company culture, looked forward to going to work everyday (unbelievable, I know, but it&#039;s true).</p> review2168: My colleagues are great. I&#039;ve never worked with such a smart group of accomplished people. The perks and food are also very compelling. The technology, rate of innovation and generally positive energy is also very high.</p> review2169: Great pay, work whenever convenient for you. The free food is simply amazing. Lots of perks like massages, micro kitchens, tech talks. The tech stops and hardware depots are great assets, you can go pick up headphones or a new keyboard and mouse for office use. The work place is very open, interaction with other employees is very easy. It is filled with very intelligent and fun people. The company is very open, you can ask questions directly to the CEO or Founders during TGIF question and answer sessions. Interns don&#039;t get nearly as much perks and benefits as full time employees, but that&#039;s expected. Google probably has one of the highest pays for interns. It is definitely one of the best places to work at.</p> review2170: 1. The people - some of the best and brightest people I&#039;ve ever met. Young, energetic, and creative people make work enjoyable, and interesting. We&#039;ve got our share of former Olympic athletes, mad scientist engineers, etc. 2. The work - We&#039;re the market leaders in so many different spaces, and it&#039;s exciting to be on the cutting edge. You get to work on things that might just change the game, and that&#039;s exhilarating. 3. It&#039;s Google!</p> review2170: The developers I work with at Google are the smartest I&#039;ve ever been around, and as a result, I&#039;ve improved my own skills more in my 9 months at Google than in both of my previous jobs. The development process runs extremely smoothly, and management doesn&#039;t get in the engineers&#039; way of creating great software. We get the best hardware to do our work on, and the non-work-related perks are wonderful... free food, great health benefits, the list goes on!</p> review2171: Almost all engineers at Google are extremely talented and a pleasure to work work. There are plenty of opportunities to work on challenging problems. The hardware and resources you can apply to those problems are unmatched anywhere else in the industry. Senior Google engineers get a lot of freedom in choosing what to work on and how to work on it; managers provide leadership and overall direction but micromanagement and design by committee is strongly discouraged. The perks are great too.</p> review2172: more freedom, relevantly less bureaucracy and harassment compare to similar size company. open access to code base, design documents cross all projects. energetic and talented engineers. free meal are very convenient. flexible working hours. core search and ads system have solid code base. solid infrastructures like mapreduce, bigtable, GFS, RPC etc are interesting to build application on. LSE are still positive models for the whole company. distributed offices offer working opportunities for people around the word. MTV main campus is dynamic and vibrate. company still attracts fresh high quality new graduates from top universities. politics is not a huge problem yet.</p> review2173: great company that treats people incredibly well by and large. The quality of people you work with day to day is just incredible -- everyone you deal with is smart, competent, has some unique skill, and brings a lot of energy to the place. I believe in what the company is doing -- yes we want to be a successful business, but we really do try to make a better consumer experience in everything we do too. I&#039;m stunned by the openness of the company -- good news and bad news is spread wide through various means. I really feel extremely lucky to be at Google, as silly as that sounds. I think it&#039;s gonna be hard to work anywhere else now.</p> review2174: You work with the best and socialize with the best so when you leave you are now ready to start something really amazing with the best.</p> review2175: Smart people, great benefits, company has a can do attitude. The company truly tries to do no evil seen it from the inside. Absolutely the best perks one can imagine. In house doctors, free food (really gourmet food), great technology and truly encourages innovation. People are in general respectful and work well together.</p> review2176: The people and the problems. Saying that &#034;the people&#034; is the best reason to work for a company is cliche, but at Google it really is. We have some of the world&#039;s foremost experts working at Google, across a broad range of disciplines. And you get to work with these people and interact with them. Now that&#039;s fun! The second and equally good thing about working at Google is that the problems we are trying to solve are hard and interesting. Another three-tiered system is not going to solve the problems I face. They are novel and exciting.</p> review2177: Bright interesting coworkers; the opportunity to take on lots of responsibility and potentially be responsible for large numbers of users or dollars very quickly; free food; health benefits. There are incredible outside speakers who come (Obama, Hillary Clinton). You&#039;ll probably only be able to see them on video unless you devote hours of your workday to waiting in line to see them in person, but it&#039;s still live and pretty darn cool! I work in Online Sales and Operations, where pretty much everyone gets a weekly one-on-one meeting with their manager. That is one upside to working in the sales organization as opposed to some other areas of the company. Many engineers have limited facetime with their manager.</p> review2178: Working with talented, driven people who I can learn from every day Working in a place where I feel I&#039;m making a difference. Working in a place where I feel I can express myself Great for the resume. I feel the experience I&#039;ve had here will be valuable in the future I have had a string of excellent managers I get to say that I work for one of the most influential companies of our time.</p> review2179: Higher total compensation than competitors - competitive salaries are augmented by large cash bonuses, equity awards, 401k matching, commuter benefits, and incredible on-campus perks, such as free meals and massages, but also including so much more. Incredibly bright coworkers. Famous computer scientists from all over the world are working in small teams at Google and the average engineer is able to approach any one of them. Very thorough annual 360 degree feedback and promotion committees to decide promotions allow individuals to succeed even if there is a disagreement with their direct manager.</p> review2179: The best reason to work at Google are the benefits. First of all, we receive three delicious meals a day! Secondly, Google goes out of their way to make it a fun place to work. From the beach volleyball court to the swimming pool, there is always something fun going on. I also enjoy the autonomy that engineers receive.</p> review2180: Great people. Great food. Total innovation! I love working at a company that has so many cool projects. A true technology company that is building new technologies to give everyone in the world internet access. Most impressive management team I&#039;ve ever worked with. The management team including founders and CEO are aware and care about everything that is going on within the company. They are willing to take risks that keep things interesting.</p> review2181: Google is the closest thing to a pure meritocracy that I&#039;ve seen in this industry, and I&#039;ve been in the industry a fair bit longer than most Googlers. It doesn&#039;t matter what your degree is in or how long you&#039;ve been at the company -- if you get stuff done and do it well you&#039;ll be treated well. And, of course, the coworkers are luminaries, but they tend (in my experience) to be accepting of newcomers without the same background. I&#039;ve had no trouble digging my fingers into topics from machine learning to the Java virtual machine, learning all the while. The company has some communication silos due to its size, but the walls aren&#039;t solid -- I routinely hack on other peoples&#039; code, and they hack back. It&#039;s all very open. They really pull out all the stops to make sure engineers can do their job, whether you need a second workstation, a thousand more machines in a datacenter, or scones. Information flow within the company is  still quite free, particularly compared to Microsoft or Apple. Managers I&#039;ve interacted with are sharp and encourage good work-life balance, reminding employees to take time off and guarding against burnout. My managers have constantly communicated their expectations and our performance, and have actively worked to help me in my career development and promotions -- or, when a project slips off track, to understand why and help. And, finally, I think Google&#039;s pay is pretty darn good. Microsoft recruiters assure me that it&#039;s 30% lower, but I&#039;ve got friends at MS and those numbers just don&#039;t add up. This site should do a good job showing the true situation (and the resulting competition will help us all!).</p> review2182: * Working on cool technology * Pushing the envelope * Good work life balance as long as you keep your head on your shoulders * Freedom to do amazing things</p> review2183: Getting a chance to work on the world&#039;s largest distributed system. Obviously the company is very focused on employee satisfaction. It&#039;s a total geek paradise, with everyone trying to out geek each other.</p> review2184: The best reasons to work at Google are: 1) You want to make a difference in the world, 2) You love a fast paced environment, 3) You love technology, and would kill to be one of the first to see and play with it. Yes, the perks are great but at the end of the day if your work impacts billions of people in a positive way, it all pays for any of the free gourmet lunches. Work at Google and be the envy of all your Friends.</p> review2185: The company is clearly at the leading edge of the new technologies that will define the high tech industry for the forseeable future.</p> review2186: Challenging, rewarding work found nowhere else. Without going into detail, Google offers problems found nowhere else in the computer industry, in many different areas. It&#039;s also pretty easy to move from one job to another if you find you&#039;re not satisfied with what you&#039;re doing.</p> review2187: You get to work on some of the biggest clusters in the world on some very hard and interesting problems. The people are generally above average and you always have to work to make sure you&#039;re doing better. For the most part its a very strong meritocracy.</p> review2188: You get to work with many smart and skillful people. This helps a lot to move on your project, learn new things, and make global impact. Also I get to work on the largest computer system in the world and I can learn all sorts of practical problems in this area. Third is the free food and perks. Every lunch and dinner is the time to social w/ your friends/coworkers at Google and you have 15+ cafeterias to iterate!</p> review2188: Interacting all the time with brilliant colleagues of high integrity and drive; strong push to innovate and change the world; excellent compensation and benefits; high openness and plenty of communication from senior management about all kind of company-strategy related issues, with lots of trust towards each and every employee.</p> review2189: Free food, and a good variety, perks, fun and competent teammates. The bonus plan is pretty good. They have a lot of social events, but unlike some other reviewers I never felt like I was forced to go to them, and I don&#039;t think I get labeled as &#039;ungoogley&#039; because of it. I feel pretty free to work on what I want to work on, and I don&#039;t feel over-managed.</p> review2190: Chance to work with smart people. Perks and benefits</p> review2191: In my opionion, Google is truly the best large company to work for. Why? 1) A common strain of intellectual curiosity among Googlers makes for one of the most stimulating learning environments. No judgment for anything other than ethical errors -- of course, it pays to be smart and make good decisions ;) 2) Family in every part of the world -- i traveled alot for work and everywhere i went, once i stepped into a google office, I felt at home. The people were just as googley, the environment was just as comfortable. I felt part of a big family. 3) A true care for employees -- benefits are benefits, but I see the heart beind it. I have never felt so taken care of by an employer nor felt an employer go out of its way to make work easy for its employees. From the ease of dealing with the tech stop (our version of technical support), to the overhaul of the mini kitchens to keep us healthy. Everything was done with heart. 4) Indiscriminate respect for all levels -- i wo rked closely with senior management and never once did i feel slighted. all opinions were considered as long as you had the &#034;balls&#034; to bring it up. I felt like a member of the team with real value add from the very start. It was a trip overseas and i was asked to lead a meeting with some officials. I was hesitant and stated my inexperience (i was 25!). my eng director at the time said one thing i would never forget: &#034;Age and experience is not an issue. You&#039;re here now and you know what we need accomplished, so i&#039;m sure you&#039;ll figure it out&#034;. 5) Autonomy -- I&#039;ve started multiple projects at google that have now taken root and have either become part of how the company is defined or have affected change in a meaningful way. None were part of my original job scope, and were ideas i took upon myself to get implemented. It truly is an entrepreneurs&#039; playground -- you need to rally support, obtain resources and push through to completio n. But if you put your mind to it, Google is a place you can get anything that has true value done.</p> review2192: The people, the culture, the fun!</p> review2193: Work with many of the brightest people on some of the most challenging problems. See your efforts noticed in the media and in the lives of your friends and family every day. Engineering at Google is, more than ever, a dream job for the right people. Think really really big! There are terrifyingly few limits to what you can do here.</p> review2194: The total compensation package is generous, with opportunities for earning more through good, hard work. The caliber of colleagues is very high, sometimes daunting even. The company is very transparent - you can get a good look at what is going on with nearly any project, and senior management frequently communicate about the direction and goals for the company. There are an amazing number of really interesting projects to get involved with, and lots of opportunities for education and professional development. Google has big values, big goals, and works to solve big problems. It is an exciting and rewarding place to be.</p> review2195: Google is a very nice company to work for. The company is very transparent about its policies and directions, and keeps every one up-to-date of latest development. People have strong ownership of things they do. And I feel that compensation is really good. The bonus is really generous (about 30% of your salary), and the benefits are excellent.</p> review2196: great pay, great flexibility. Nobody pampers engineers like Google. Focus is on small teams, self-starting and self-motivating engineers. Much less power politics than I&#039;ve found elsewhere.</p> review2197: Huge variety of projects, wonderful people, brilliant minds, awesome perks, fairly easy to move from project to project, real room for independent initiative (management rarely blocks new ideas and rarely interferes with decision making), stock options and shares very valuable. If you&#039;re looking to be immersed in the internet world, become involved with really (really) big business, and see how huge scale matters and how it is handled and developed, there&#039;s hardly a better place for this than Google. Free lunch and free transportation are more than just nifty perks. They make people&#039;s lives really easy and support a work environment that&#039;s very productive without being oppressive. Nobody is required to work long hours, but a lot of people just do.</p> review2197: The food is, in general, great, and the number of cafeteria options is ridiculous. There&#039;s always something interesting going on--it is a treat to see all of the invited authors and politicians that drop by and give talks. As an engineer it is relatively easy to switch projects, at least if you have a manager who is on your side. There are many smart people at Google, and you will learn a lot from them. In general, the engineers at Google are quite nice and easy to work with. You meet the occasional bad apple, though. It is quite gratifying to learn the inner-workings of products used the world over.</p> review2198: Working at Google, you have really smart co-workers. In the beginning it struck me that people quickly understood my ideas, something I wasn&#039;t used to from college. Another great advantage at Google is that it is very engineering driven. Generally, engineers are given enough of freedom to work on what they consider to be most important. The role of product managers is to help engineers figure out what that is and to help in communications, but ultimately engineers are making the decision. Being an engineer, I very much enjoy this and I think it makes a lot of sense given that engineers understand the technologies involved best.</p> review2199: The benefits are the best. Free gourmet food, a great gym, subsidized massages, trips to disneyland, etc. The people you are working with are some of the smartest around.</p> review2200: The fringe benefits and work life balance are strong reasons, coupled with competitive total compensation.</p> review2201: There are many things to highlight here: the talented people I work with; the perks (there are really good stuff here, life a awesome health insurance, gym, plenty off food, etc). And why not mention the prestige to work on such famous company. This can really open a lot of door both currently and in the future.</p> review2202: great place to work, great perks, great collegues!</p> review2203: The opportunity to work on projects that are interesting and cutting-edge.</p> review2204: Strong culture that treats employees with respect and highly values engineers. Openness of culture that includes access to the majority of the codebase as well as regular TGIF&#039;s on fridays where management shares what&#039;s going on across the company with all the employees and can include sensitive information. Political candidates all stop at Google for a talk including: John McCain, Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, John Edwards, and many others. Author talks with free books.</p> review2205: A very high percentage of people are very qualified for their jobs. Everyone knows that everyone else can be trusted to get work done and this creates a great &#034;flow&#034; for projects. This is in contrast to most other places I&#039;ve been where there are always someone in each team that isn&#039;t carrying their weight. The management is generally light and easy-going (in my experience) and people just do their jobs. There seems to be a genuine effort to improve employee skills. I have no doubt this is simply for the company&#039;s sake and not due to love for the employees, but it&#039;s nice nonetheless.</p> review2206: You are surrounded by by brilliant people. The executive team truly believes in making the world a better place - and they truly do &#034;care&#034; about their employees. Depending on your actual department - I am pretty sure most people would agree that they learn more here in 1 week - then you would in 1 year elsewhere. Its a very forward thinking organization - that is never satisfied with how things went the last time - there is a constant drive to do things better than the last time - and that culture is great for personal development.</p> review2206: Awesome people: Google definitely has some of the best people to work with as well as to learn from. There are lots of opportunities to learn new things wether it&#039;s from tech talks, talking with coworkers or interaction with people from other departments. Everybody is friendly and the work atmosphere is casual and down to earth. Great Perks: Even working as a contractor, I&#039;ve had access to free breakfast, lunch and dinner as well as access to the gym and shuttle service.</p> review2207: The Googleplex, the free food/drinks/snacks, cool t-shirts and hats, on-site gym &amp; volleyball and the heated toilets. And of course to the entire world it seems like the &#034;coolest&#034; place to work on the planet, so it looks good on your resume. You will gain respect from peers because of the perceived difficulty of getting a job at Google... Smartest people in the Bay area in one place...</p> review2208: Google&#039;s management allows, or rather, encourages engineers to take as much ownership as they like of projects. Product managers are there to work with engineers to direct the product, as their job is to know the customers and the marketplace and come up with a good direction for products. Because a lot of what the marketplace wants is illogical, engineers often argue with product management, and such behavior is part of what makes engineering a great place to be. You can actually have a significant impact on product direction. Additionally, Google is very fair about how promotions work. The engineers who impress their colleagues get promoted. Those who don&#039;t impress their colleagues don&#039;t get promoted. Thus, most good engineers will get promoted. I&#039;ve heard lots of people complain about this process, but usually I hear this from engineers who aren&#039;t that impressive. It could be that the explanation for *why* they aren&#039;t getting promo ted isn&#039;t transparent enough...but I don&#039;t know. In almost all situations, you are in control of your own destiny at Google. You set your own goals. You set your own timeline to achieve those goals. Management is there to guide you in setting these goals, but it is your duty to set good goals and strive to achieve them. This is also very empowering, and avoids the micromanagement that occurs at other companies. Then there&#039;s the obvious, which everyone else has already mentioned, like the *great* food, the massages, the really understanding/flexible management when it comes to personal issues, the good benefit package, etc.</p> review2209: The company is very transparent - you can get a good look at what is going on with nearly any project, and senior management frequently communicate about the direction and goals for the company. There are an amazing number of really interesting projects to get involved with, and lots of opportunities for education and professional development.</p> review2210: Google without a doubt hires the best and the brightest. This makes for a stimulating work environment where one is constantly challenged. One of the biggest things that Google has going for it is its legendary benefits...it&#039;s hard to tire of free food, personal enrichment classes, and great health insurance. Google also makes for a &#034;fun&#034; work environment -- although it&#039;s definitely still work, the balance balls, lava lamps, game rooms, and Googley colors surrounding your work environment is definitely unique to the company.</p> review2211: Google is in the process of changing the world, or more specifically, how the world uses information. It has been a great pleasure to see this process take form and execute over the last 3 years. The career advancement is good and there are plenty of opportunities to showcase you talent. This can be a double edged sword if you trip up but since you have to be pretty good to get in at Google then that shoudl not be a major concern.</p> review2212: Opportunities to make impact on a large scale. And the perks are great.</p> review2213: The quality of my co-workers is phenomenal. You can be sure that any idea you might have will be thorougly analyzed and considered. People are friendly, intelligent and in the vast majority of cases very easy to get along with. The infrastructure that Google has built up really frees the programmer from a lot of fundamental worries and allows him or her to concentrate on solving the high-level problem. The available tools make accessing a tremendous amount of computing power very straightforward. I have always been satisfied with my managers trust me when I say I need to take time off or work from home. It is very liberating to know that your manager supports you when you need this kind of latitude because of things happening outside work.</p> review2214: It&#039;s nice to feel like part of something greater than oneself — Google has a whole lot going on at any given time, and there is a strongly intellectually curious atmosphere among the employees. The perks are fantastic, too — there is no easy nor compelling way to argue against free hot meals up to three times a day, and there&#039;s always something exciting or interesting or intellectually challenging to work on. The colorful and relatively playful atmosphere are also an excellent change of pace from the standard-issue dreary cubicle existence that plagues most office jobs out there in the US.</p> review2215: Incredibly smart people. The culture of openness. And obviously the perks.</p> review2215: There is a tremendous amount of bright, highly-motivated people at Google and you can learn a lot from most of them. They continually challenge you and make you better at what you do.</p> review2216: Like a new restaurant with a line out the door you want to get in and have dinner. But seriously they do provide some nice perks. (Lunch, Dinner, Snacks, Insurance)</p> review2217: I like working at Google as an SRE (Site Reliability Engineer) because it is a job that combines my skills as a professional software engineer and self-taught system administrator. The work I do is quite varied so I don&#039;t get bored doing the same thing over and over like I have done at other companies. Since Google is a well-established corporation they can afford to provide some of the best benefits that other companies can&#039;t/don&#039;t provide. Unlike startups, you don&#039;t have to worry about the company going belly-up nor do you have to work unreasonable hours. We have free food in the form of many cafes all over the area each with a varied menu of foods. There&#039;s even a concern program that allows employees to call certain specialists for free advice -- e.g. you can ask a lawyer for some legal advice or talk to a therapist, amongst other services. The company even offers up to 3 months of paid medical leave.. Aside from benefits, job security,  and exciting projects, everyone there is very intelligent and good peers/team-mates are essential in any corporation.</p> review2218: It&#039;s a very convenient place to work-- not only are the on-site perks helpful, but employees have plenty of opportunities to learn. Unlike many companies, where employee productivity is dependent already having a certain set of skills needed to get the job done, Google encourages (if not expected) employees to spend a majority of their time doing things they don&#039;t currently know how to do. In effect, you are getting paid to learn new skills, and due to the &#034;act now, think later&#034; Google mindset, it&#039;s generally okay to make mistakes as you learn. World-renowned industry experts regularly lecture at Google, giving the campus an even stronger college-like feel. And in terms of the perks, it&#039;s surprisingly nice to not have to think about packing a lunch, to be able to borrow a free car to run an errand, and to wash your stinky gym clothes after working out your frustrations in the weight room.</p> review2219: The perks and the people. Everyone knows Google so when you say you work there you don&#039;t have to explain what it means. The idea that when I checked in code to production, billions of people would be hitting it the next day - very heady.</p> review2220: The benefits and coddling at the company</p> review2221: Great Pay and Benefits, and a very dynamic work environment. You are surrounded by very smart people and you get to work on cutting edge technology. It&#039;s a fun place with the look and feel of a college campus. You are constantly challenged due to the fast pace and the intelligence of your co-workers.</p> review2222: interesting challenges that change every day. feel good about what you&#039;re doing. financial rewards</p> review2223: Very friendly culture, incredible access to practically all of company information, great people to work with and learn from. With thousands of users every second, almost nothing is trivial, so work tends to never be boring. The work process is very professional. Of course, just getting to build stuff on Google&#039;s awesome infrastructure (both hw and sw) might also be considered to be interesting :)</p> review2224: The food is outstanding. There are good people who have every right to be elitist who are not (not sure how many are left though). If you enjoy building teams and enjoy having the resources to execute on projects then Google is a good place to be. Depending upon how your options are priced Google can lead you to a rich life of spending your time commenting on Google on web sites like this.</p> review2224: The company has name recognition. Also, in engineering at least, you learn a lot about best practices. Most Googlers are pleasant and competent.</p> review2225: Interesting problems to work on, very nice offices, extremely smart co workers. If you&#039;re very self directed, you can learn quite a bit and have a great time, but you shouldn&#039;t expect much help from other people.</p> review2226: -My co-workers - working with smart and creative people -Great working environment and benefits -Academic environment promoting continued learning</p> review2227: Smart people, extremely diverse culture, open environment for creativity... a model for a lot of companies. Technically very advanced - start of the art equipment and the best social activities that make you proud to be there.</p> review2228: The people are pretty fantastic, as are the perks -- food, HR really does have innovative ways of taking care of you, transportation options. Google has been willing to open up offices where its people want to be, which has been great. There is a lot of opportunity to travel, and communicate your vision to a wider audience. I appreciate some of the hard work that has gone into building the culture and Google tries hard to maintain that. There is a sense of legacy and that great things are yet to come. This is not something that is easily sustained, yet there is so much effort here, that it just might work.</p> review2229: LV style Free Meal. Free Shuttle. Campus environment. Salary is so so. Best 1st job out of college.</p> review2230: Google, even through a period of explosive growth, continues to be a great innovation hub. The engineering culture has managed to attract some of the brightest minds in computer science, with access to vast resources and people with experience and expertise across a broad range of functions. Working at Google is a fantastic way to meet and learn from some of these folks, and to gain exposure to some of the largest distributed computing systems in the world. And of course, the benefits are best-in-class, included the lauded Google chefs and various on-site amenities. If you can find a way to build some upside, whether that&#039;s around compensation, equity, or career advancement, Google is a fantastic place to work.</p> review2231: The food, the people, the development infrastructure, the energetic atmosphere, and the large scale problems that do not exist anywhere else.</p> review2232: No company has ever done more to ensure the happiness and comfort of their employees. It has of course grown more compartmentalized and beaurocratic as it has grown but it remains a rather open playing field. Google also fosters a fertile and receptive breeding ground for homegrown ideas and suggestions, some of which has grown into successful consumer products. I also continue to feel good about working for a company that takes ethics and &#034;doing the right thing&#034; so seriously.</p> review2233: Stock options, prestige of working for a huge name</p> review2233: Its famous, its been &#034;best employer&#034; for 2 years now !</p> review2234: They are very concerned with the happiness of their employees. We are treated well and the perks are phenomenal. This is one of the pinnacles for where geeks want to work. The work environment is condusive to working and staying engaged in the projects you are working on. They make sure you have the tools that you need to get your work done. They move VERY fast to get things done. They do a lot of great work with charities and the communities where their offices are. They truly live by their motto, &#034;Don&#039;t be evil.&#034;</p> review2235: They definitely encourage a good work life balance. When dealing with other areas of life, they ensure that employees are given enough time to take care of everything. The perks are great as well - free food, snacks, and drinks, author talks, artists who perform, game areas - these are all things that relieve stress and enable employees to focus better and be more productive.</p> review2236: The benefits are awesome and work hours are very flexible.</p> review2237: The perks and the culture is not only conductive to thinking and personal growth, but also fun.</p> review2238: Any alien technology, sufficiently advanced, will appear to be magic. Compared to what anyone else is doing what Google has built in its worldwide serving infrastructure is magic. No-one, not even Defense, has the compute power on the scale that Google has. If you can manage to live up to the challenge you are in the very top echelon of engineering talent in the world. There is also a culture of rewarding and supporting us engineers in building and maintaining that infrastructure.</p> review2239: Google is an extraordinary place to work: the perks are second to none, the quality of employees is exceptionally high, and the products are mostly cutting edge and interesting. Google treats its employees very well and believes in leadership from the bottom up, which provides a sense of ownership and personal investment that is unequaled in my experience. Google employees are encouraged to treat each other as respected equals, no matter what the difference in job title might be. Google also encourages the notion that good ideas can come from anywhere, and that the best ideas rarely come from management. Perhaps most importantly, Google is one of the only places in the world where you can work on products that could potentially be used by hundreds of millions of people. It&#039;s very satisfying to share your work with family and friends, and to see people using your products nearly every day.</p> review2240: The reputation of the company is great, and so is the free food.</p> review2241: Smart People Chance to make a big difference to the lives of millions of people Management&#039;s desire to be seen as a force for good Fellow Googlers&#039; concern for the environment and heightened awareness of world issues</p> review2242: Google has a really strong reputation and is a word leader in internet technology. Working at Google opens a lot of doors for later employment externally and also gives you a lot of insight into what it&#039;s like to work for a large company that is still in a growth phase. Google also hires very intelligent, hardworking individuals, so you meet a lot of amazing people and work with them every day. It also provides great benefits (health, dental, etc.), and a lot of really nice perks (free food, gym, special guests/events). It&#039;s also a good first place to work in Silicon Valley because you learn a lot very quickly about the Valley&#039;s culture from an established organization.</p> review2242: When people think of working for Google, the food and facilities are generally what come to mind first…and those are the best parts. Google fosters a college or academic feel where you never need to leave the campus in order to find sustenance or a respite from the daily grind. Breakfast, lunch and dinner are offered Monday through Friday, and the food is pretty good (keep in mind I&#039;m comparing it to other free food…so how can you really complain?). Google-colored Swiss balls (those bouncy orbs you see freakishly fit people doing sit-ups on in infomercials) invade the office cubicles and give the workspace a much more play-pen sort of feel. To bolster the dorm room ambiance, Google also supplies pinball machines; foosball, ping pong &amp; pool tables; and assorted video games. Foam darts are passed out for &#039;dart wars&#039; during especially hectic times, and silently encourage the employees to roll away from their ergonomically arranged desks to flin g projectiles at unsuspecting coworkers. After a grueling week of work, an employee can look forward to a company-funded bender in the form of microbrew beer (both on tap and in bottles!), wine, and the occasional Jell-O shot. If the alcohol upsets your stomach and a retreat to a bathroom is what you crave, fear not! In addition to having showers in almost every building, Google boasts toilets with heated seats, built-in bidets, and dryers for those who prefer to relieve themselves in a more &#034;green&#034; fashion.</p> review2243: Very smart, innovative colleagues. Ground breaking technology. Open door policy to executives. Foster supportive, team environment</p> review2244: People think better of you if you work at Google. The people you work with are really really smart, because Google sets the bar for hiring so high. There&#039;s free breakfast, lunch, and dinner - and it&#039;s good. The yearly bonus tends to be even more than the percentage in the offer letter.</p> review2245: Google is one of the first places I&#039;ve worked where I feel like I&#039;m surrounded by people that are way smarter than I am. This makes for a really creative environment, where everyone is pushing you to go beyond your limits and make something even better. It also means that you can just trust that everyone around you is really good at what they do. There&#039;s also a huge focus on only launching things when they&#039;re ready, which, as an engineer, means when something does launch, you&#039;re really proud of it, and don&#039;t feel like it&#039;s half-assed because you were rushing to a deadline and cut a lot of corners. Oh, and the free food and benefits rock, but they wouldn&#039;t keep me at any job if I didn&#039;t enjoy the work and the people. But when you do like the job and the people, they make it that much better:)</p> review2246: The people at google are nice</p> review2247: The best part about working at Google is the number of very smart people constantly around you. Great team settings where you can learn and be around the best. There are tons of other employee benefits as well, such as the free food (3 meals a day cooked by excellent chefs) and snacks, game areas (fooseball, volleyball), bicycles, workout center, laundry machines, etc. All of these things cause you to worry about less outside of work.</p> review2248: Good benefits, decent pay. Free food, and access to many amenities.</p> review2249: You work with the brightest people in the world who are also very modest and kind. Very fun, enjoyable, flexible atmosphere where you can be yourself. Every day I was there I found another reason to love it. The campus is very well connected and collegial. The food is obviously amazing. They are also always inviting speakers and musicians and finding ways to keep you entertained and learning. I could go on and on, but I was very happy there.</p> review2250: The opportunity to change the world. Every job position has a very strong impact, especially in the emerging Google divisions. For example, Google Enterprise and Google Earth sales groups. Free food. Very open minded and diverse group of people. No one I met at Google is intellectually incompetent. You can bring dogs to work. The people are friendly and overall there is strong sense of belonging to a group of the elite that have the opportunity to change the world. The on site gym, cafes, are nice. Opportunities to see visiting authors and presidential candidates are amazing. You are in the presence of great people who will change/are changing the world.</p> review2251: If you ever want to leave and go somewhere else, pretty much anyone will hire you if you&#039;ve worked at Google.</p> review2251: Great people Impact Great Benefts</p> review2252: An amazing spirit of innovation, open collaborative atmosphere, great employee development and career advancement, and exceptional senior management.</p> review2253: The &#034;pro&#034; that comes to mind that I want to mention about the company is that you get the opportunity to learn a lot.</p> review2254: The different perks you get at this company are really great and the benefits are pretty great here as well.</p> review2255: Perks and incentives are a major plus. I work with a lot of smart people and the people are the best part.</p> review2256: We are at the forefront of new technology and so we are working with very high tech professionals every day.</p> review2257: Great insurance benefits, free food, equipment is available whenever you want it to be, and there is always whatever you need (monitor, etc.)</p> review2258: Great people to work with here, as well as an enjoyable work environment. I love to come to work every day!</p> review2259: The variety of different projects and the speed of completion. I am truly very satisfied - pleased there is an endless list of pros.</p> review2260: As you&#039;ve probably heard, Google has great benefits (insurance) and flexible hours. If you want to, you can work from home.</p> review2260: What I seem to like best here is the open environment at the company, as well as the transparency on the job.</p> review2261: To repeat what I wrote before, the people I work for and work with here are very smart and confident people.</p> review2262: People are willing to share knowledge which is not the norm in this industry. This is the first place I have worked where the people are great about that.

Benefits and facilities are great.</p> review3086: I worked at Google for five years and in that time saw several changes. The people are the best part of the job although it&#039;s very dependent on WHO those people are. Unfortunately, a lot of the really good people have moved on.

The entire company and all of its employees enjoy learning and it is very respected when you take internal training courses and/or share industry information with your peers. You are expected to be brilliant. You are expected to output great, creative, innovative work. You are expected to be the best of the best. And they only hire the best candidates out of top-tier private schools with applicable research, industry or work experience.</p> review3340: Many colleagues are good people and good at their job, it&#039;s exciting to work at somewhere so influential, it&#039;s good on the resume, great food</p> review3340: - Technical resources - Benefits and Perks - Huge number of interesting projects - Smart coworkers - Freedom to manage your own work</p> review3341: The benefits are unparalleled and I really enjoyed the causal work atmosphere. Also, the people were among the smartest I&#039;ve ever worked with</p> review3342: Smart peers, good benefits, interesting work</p> review3343: Amazing benefits, very qualified people (overqualified actually), relaxed work environment, very hard to get fired, always work in a global environment, lots of cross-team collaboration, lots of social events.</p> review3344: - excellent perks - good management - no micro managing - lots of interesting projects - great coworkers - flexibility about telecommuting</p> review3345: -Amazing perks....free gym, food is the best. -Young and fun co workers.</p> review3346: Good Benefits and Good good</p> review3347: Great Atmosphere and people working there</p> review3348: -Free food -Very young management and college-like atmosphere -Google&#039;s market dominance and absence of significant competitors -Potential for high salaries at the higher management levels -Very smart people</p> review3349: I believe that Google offers one of the best internships available to students. They not only issue students a great deal of responsibility, they also cater a great deal socially, organising many events (from mini-festivals, to international internship expos, to sea safari&#039;s in Dublin). During the internship, I had many 1:1 meetings with my manager who offered good advice and feedback about the project I was given. Great brand name on the CV.</p> review3349: Free food, cool perks, 30&#034; screen, smart people. Great positive environment if you are in one of the few projects with an excellent manager. Brand name: it will help a lot to have Google on your resumé when you&#039;ll run away.</p> review3350: Great transparency within the company where you can learn a lot. Abundance of great, intelligent people in the company. Lots of exciting opportunities within Google. Great benefits and perks. Employees are well respected by company.</p> review3351: Google is a great place to start your career. They&#039;re one of the few companies that was willing to train new college grads and let them join a fun, youthful team of smart people. Plus, the food and benefits can&#039;t be beat.</p> review3352: Google is a company of constant change, and opportunities abound for the hungry. Management are eager to spot talent and bring them forward.</p> review3353: Benefits are the cool dude.</p> review3354: The food, the quality of your co-workers</p> review3355: The people and the food, in that order. I&#039;ve met some truly brilliant individuals in my years at Google and have learned a lot just by striking up conversations. Coworkers tend to be very cooperative and willing to share knowledge. It can also be quite a fun environment in which to work, but not in an &#034;organized fun&#034; kind of way. Although there is plenty of &#034;organized fun&#034; (well, not as much since the recession began), spontaneous team outings and conversations over coffee are much more enjoyable.</p> review3356: flexiable and creative job. very special data centre design, advanced clound computing and server system</p> review3357: My story is a little different than most others because I was a temp worker for Google, testing search results for a year. I enjoyed the work a great deal; there were always new interesting things to test, and I got to see things like Maps and Timelines long before they were released to the public and help make them better. The pay was reasonable - $15/hour working from home - and there were good bonuses after a certain number of hours had been completed, or occasionally given for working on specific projects.</p> review3358: I&#039;ve also heard about how Google&#039;s stack ranking-based review system is obsolete and is an unfair way to rate employees. I suspect that most of the people who complain fall on the low end of the review scale. Personally, I have never paid much attention to the review process, and I have never felt unfairly treated by it. I am also one of those people who delights in knowing that there is always someone smarter than me at Google that I can learn from. Since I&#039;m always learning from someone, I&#039;m always improving, and always holding my own in the stack rankings. Google does not and should not reward complacency. While I&#039;m sure the review process can be improved, I&#039;ve also witnessed that it has been slowly evolving for years so I&#039;m content that people are working to improve the process.</p> review3358: fast paced environment, opportunities to learn, super smart and nice coworkers, free food</p> review3359: Your colleagues. More than anything else, I really enjoy working somewhere where I can rely on not just the competence but as importantly the friendliness and general willingness to pitch in, of my colleagues. It is also lovely to work somewhere that genuinely does seem to try and do the right thing. (That sounds like schmaltz but it is true).</p> review3360: 2 types of people that will find a great place to work: (1) recent college or B-school graduates looking for a first job where they can learn a lot, and (2) more senior corporate executives with many years of experience who aren&#039;t overly ambitious and are looking for a role where they can put life on auto-pilot and glide through their day-to-day activities.</p> review3361: Google is a place with amazing learning opportunities - lots of very smart, skilled people to learn from.</p> review3362: Great benefits, this is the main reason people site for working at Google. My colleagues were fantastic and make my daily life at Google much happier.</p> review3363: Google engineers are some of the best I&#039;ve ever worked with.</p> review3364: - Pay - Culture - Reputation</p> review3365: relaxed work sphere, friendly people</p> review3366: The quality of the people and the ambitiousness of what we&#039;re doing is quite something. I&#039;ve seen a lot of other companies from the outside, as a former strategy consultant, and Google&#039;s more extraordinary than a lot of those on the inside realise. The culture&#039;s very transparent (though that may reflect function / geography) and impressively flat. Which isn&#039;t to say there aren&#039;t title and salary differences, but that fantastic people with lowly titles are given the space and encouragement to do fantastic things.</p> review3367: No problem is too large to tackle. You get a chance to work on things not possible elsewhere because of the scale of the resources you have available. You also work with very smart and capable people.</p> review3367: Perks. Free food and other facilities. You&#039;ll work on something that is used by millions of people. Opportunity to work with some of the best people in country.</p> review3368: The free food is fantastic, Google grabs attention on your C.V.</p> review3369: Brilliant, friendly co-workers, relaxed environment, and free food are all big plusses. Also, having Google on your resume opens a lot of doors and enhances your personal branding.</p> review3370: The work atmosphere is great and the company makes effort in taking care of the employees.</p> review3371: The scopes are good for future developments. This is a place which offers great opportunities to move forward in life. i get commendable help from my managers and other senors in case if i face any problem with my work. the work environment is fun filled and motivates me to work well and complete tasks within the deadlines. The pay is quite high. Moreover, this company offers very attractive benefit packages to all its employees and also many vacations. Added to this is the fairness in offering us promotions and rewards for delivering good performance. The name Google India is a good break to have been added on our resumes indeed!</p> review3372: The food is the best reason.</p> review3373: If you are an engineer, it&#039;s wonderful. The place is built by engineers, for engineers. The company&#039;s rules, structure and processes usually make sense, and when when they don&#039;t, anyone can fix them, if they can get enough people to reach a consensus. Promotions sometimes seem very difficult - but well earned, and very fair.</p> review3374: Free Food !!! Great people. It feels like staying in college if you are a bottom employee (foosball tournament, PS3, Wii...). You can learn so much from the company and others because everybody is talented. Very fast moving environment. It is a meritocracy, if you are good, you will be recognized and remunerated. You will work in the most international environment possible with colleagues from all around the globe.</p> review3375: Smart &amp; passion. That&#039;s great company.</p> review3376: The potential opportunity to work on something great that millions of people will use. You can learn a lot while working along with a group of very smart people. The benefits package is quite strong. On the whole, google treats its employees very well.</p> review3376: 2 types of people that will find a great place to work: (1) recent college or B-school graduates looking for a first job where they can learn a lot, and (2) more senior corporate executives with many years of experience who aren&#039;t overly ambitious and are looking for a role where they can put life on auto-pilot and glide through their day-to-day activities.</p> review3377: Nette Kollegen und Vorgesetzte usw. Alles easy Nettes Ambiente, höflich und smooth, gimmicks are the best ja und so sehr auf trab</p> review3378: Goede verdiende baan. Leuke mensen. Goed nagedacht over hoe mensen goed kunnen werken alleen om met een groep.</p> review3379: - Best and free lunch! - Nice colleagues - creative atmosphere - Cool office with a bed (!) for those who want to take a break from work. - lovely roof terrace</p> review3380: Great environment to develop yourself and work in a pleasant atmosphere. Also space for personal development.</p> review3381: Kollegen, Gehalt, Perks, man lernt immer wieder was Neues</p> review3382: Kreatives Umfeld, gute Teamstruktur, gutes Image</p> review3383: Très bonne performance pour les employés</p> review3384: Bonne ambiance bonne collaboration J&#039;ai beaucoup apprécié travailler dans cette entreprise</p> review3385: gute atmosphäre, angenehmes klima, tolles team</p> review3385: geht so aber es kann besser sein</p> review3386: - Kollegen - Perks, Office Location - Internationalität</p> review3387: Réputation et cadre de travail</p> review3388: Evolutivité du poste, qualité de la restauration, intérêt des projets</p> review3389: Junges Team, tolle Büros, kostenloses Essen und viele Benefits</p> review3394: Zéro pression.
